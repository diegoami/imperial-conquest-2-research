# Environment

## Model quota availability: quota-tracker

A local service, quota-tracker, reports how much subscription quota is left on these providers:
claude, openai (ChatGPT plan, used via OpenCode), zai (GLM Coding Plan), opencode_go (OpenCode Go)
and openrouter (prepaid credit). Check it whenever you need to know whether a provider can be used
right now, before choosing, recommending or delegating to a model.

### Querying (read-only, localhost, no auth, results cached 60 s)
- `curl -s localhost:8765/quota`: every provider
- `curl -s localhost:8765/quota/<provider>`: one provider
- `curl -s localhost:8765/best`: providers with quota left, most headroom first
- `curl -s localhost:8765/avoid`: providers out of quota, with when each is usable again
- Add `?refresh` to bypass the cache.

Each provider has:
- `status`: `ok` (under 80% used), `low` (80% or more), `exhausted` (95% or more: don't use until
  `available_at` / `available_in`), `error` (couldn't be checked; `error` says why), `not_configured`
- `headroom_pct`: percent left on its most-used window
- `windows[]`: every limit, with `name`, `used_pct`, `resets_at` (unix s), `resets_in`

### Models per provider
| provider    | heavy                                             | light                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| claude      | `claude --model opus`                             | `claude --model sonnet`                               |
| openai      | `opencode -m openai/gpt-6.1-sol`                  | `opencode -m openai/gpt-5.6-luna`                     |
| zai         | `opencode -m zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3`             | `opencode -m zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3-flash`           |
| opencode_go | `opencode -m opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro`         | `opencode -m opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`         |
| openrouter  | `opencode -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` | `opencode -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` |

Facts that affect availability:
- `gpt-5.6-luna` has its own weekly limit: for light tasks openai is usable while the
  `gpt-5.6-luna:7d` window in `/quota/openai` is under 95%, even if openai is exhausted.
- openrouter is prepaid credit: its windows never reset, and `remaining_usd` is the balance.

### If the service isn't running
Check: `curl -sf localhost:8765/health`. If that fails:
1. `systemctl --user restart quota-tracker`, wait a few seconds, check `/health` again.
2. If systemctl says `Failed to connect to bus`, ask the owner to run
   `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`, then retry step 1.
3. If it still fails, read `journalctl --user -u quota-tracker -n 50` and tell the owner what it says.
4. To run it without the service: `cd ~/projects/models_quota_tracker && uv run quota-tracker serve`
   (in the background; it stops when the session ends).

### Don't
- Don't read or edit `~/.config/quota-tracker/config.toml`; it holds account tokens.
- If a provider shows `error` about an expired cookie or token, tell the owner; renewing it needs
  their browser or login.
