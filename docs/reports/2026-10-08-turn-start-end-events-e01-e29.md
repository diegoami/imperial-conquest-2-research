# Turn-start and turn-end events — verification of rows E01–E29

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`11c44460ebb2694ea6e33e9f8eda87ef8ac1ec16` (short `11c4446`, captured
post-push by `git log -1 origin/main --format=%H`; the relay's SHA
citation matches the on-`main` commit). Release
`run-exp-feature-inventory`, asset `FI_batch1_screenshots.tar.gz`.

**Closes** the cell-level verification of E01–E29 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
The largest section of the inventory (29 rows). All rows are either
`[confirmed]` (live-save evidence) or `[derived]` (decompile-only, with
the dispatching function cited in the inventory). Coverage: `coverage.md
§4` and several research-side reports
(`R:decompiled-quarterly-billing-and-economy.md`,
`R:decompiled-turn-and-calendar-sequencing.md`,
`R:city-population-growth.md`,
`R:army-moves-field-signed-and-the-ffff-underflow.md`, etc.).

**Tag policy:** carried from inventory; this draft tightens the
cell-level evidence without re-tagging. The dominant tag is `[derived]`;
the `[confirmed]` sub-rows are listed in the relay's highlights
(E02 / E05 / E06 / E09 / E10 / E11 / E20 / E23 / E24 / E27 / E28).

## Five open notes

1. **E07 ("paint onto calm")** is `[derived]` and the inventory's note
   records the correction: *"code 1 is rough sea: a weekly weather
   overlay that FUN_00451304 / FUN_004511bc paint onto calm sea (code 0)
   and clear again a week later. The DAT holds no code-1 cell."* Carrying
   forward per the inventory's explicit correction note in
   `R:terrain-move-cost-table-in-dat.md`.
2. **E13's "no save held a city below loyalty 39"** is `[derived]`
   carry-over per the inventory's row prose. Reproduction would need a
   controlled save that takes a city below 30 loyalty (a long siege with
   high tax).
3. **E15's "desertion takes the army's last unit's place; supplies
   troops div 100 tons"** is the only `[code]` carry-over; not in
   literals.
4. **E19's "winter famine / loyalty -1 with 1/3 chance"** is
   `[derived]` — no save held an empty winter stock (every test's cities
   had positive supply going into winter).
5. **E25's fleet-moves formula details (30 - (ships-50)/10 -
   troops/100/ships - 3 at zero supplies; (70 - condition) >> 2 when
   below 70)** are `[derived]` carry-over from the inventory's row
   prose.

## Inferences

- **`FUN_00451b40` is the quarterly-tick dispatcher**, the single
  function called from E03 / E13 / E16 / E17 / E29. Carrying this as a
  *single* function across rows means a reproduction can wire one shared
  helper with branching per-tick sub-routine, rather than five
  independent functions.
- **The dispatching functions cited in the inventory's `X:` column are
  the highest-confidence pointers** for each row's behaviour;
  `[derived]` carry-over flags them as decompile-only with no live-save
  test.
- **E09 / E11 / E21 share `FUN_0044b27c`** (the siege dispatch); E21's
  "capture-after-siege" path then runs `FUN_0044bed8` (the city ownership
  transfer) or `FUN_0044c528` (the elimination). Three rows share a
  function stack — reproductions need this stack, not the row-by-row
  entry points.

## What this does not establish

- E07's weather-overlay paint (open note 1).
- E13's no-below-loyalty-39 save (open note 2).
- E15's desertion semantics (open note 3).
- E19's winter-famine path (open note 4).
- E25's exact fleet-moves formula details (open note 5).

## Reproduction

```bash
# function-table search for the dispatchers

     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/function_list.tsv
# coverage rows for E03/E04/E05/E19/E22/E23

```

The function + coverage extracts are deterministic. Re-running the
existing quarterly-tick tests in `tests/test_orders.py` covers the live
evidence path for the rows that have it.
