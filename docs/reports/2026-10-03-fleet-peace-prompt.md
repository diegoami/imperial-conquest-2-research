# Attacking a fleet of a nation you are not at war with: a Yes/No/Cancel box, Yes declares war on it and on its ally, and the battle follows at once

**Status:** promoted from the `ic2-conquest` draft of the same name (branch `experiment/peace-prompt`, commit `04168e3`). **Wine-only: every result below is a candidate until the desktop original confirms it.** It closes the open item of [2026-10-02-naval-battles.md](2026-10-02-naval-battles.md) ("the peace prompt for a fleet: not tested, they were at war"). **Natural state, nothing edited.** Five trials (No, Cancel, Yes × 3 seeds) from one fixture.

**Answer.**
- **Clicking an adjacent fleet of a nation you are on trade terms with opens a box with Yes, No and Cancel**, read as "Are you sure you want to attack this fleet ?" (the driver's text read is garbled; the question is the one the research reports quote). The battle does not start until it is answered.
- **No and Cancel change nothing:** both fleets' ships, condition, moves and owners and both relation entries (trade, 1 and 1) were identical before and after.
- **Yes declares war and fights at once:** both relation entries went from 1 to **3 immediately**, the battle was instant (the attacker's fleet destroyed, the defender's reduced, as in [2026-10-02-naval-battles.md](2026-10-02-naval-battles.md): Ptolemaic 70 × 63 against Carthage 90 × 74 lost in all three seeds), and the next autosave's news reads **"PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON CARTHAGE."**, **"PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON NUMIDIA."**, "Carthage sinks fleet of Ptolemaic." in that order.
- **The war reaches the target's ally:** Numidia was Carthage's ally (relation 2) and at peace with Ptolemaic (0); after the attack Ptolemaic's relation to Numidia was **3 (war)** as well, and Greece, on trade terms with both, was unchanged (1).

## Method

- **Fixture:** `python3 -m tests.make_fleet_battle_fixture --no-war` repeats the pair-1 staging ([2026-10-02-fleets-sail-and-drift.md](2026-10-02-fleets-sail-and-drift.md)) **without** Carthage's war order: the same sailing, the same positions at 0723 (Ptolemaic's seat): Ptolemaic fleet 1 at (111,73), 70 ships, condition 63; Carthage fleet 0 at (110,73), 90 ships, condition 74; both supplies 0; relation **1 (trade)** both ways (`T1P_FIXTURE_fleets_adjacent.SAV`, from `T1P_0723_s02_Ptolemaic.SAV`). Build and seed as in the other findings (`354d8265…532f`, Wine 9.0, Xvfb, one process per trial).
- **Trials** (`runs/experiments/fleet-battles/peace_prompt.py`): load the fixture with the seed; read both fleets and both relation entries (nation records, `+0x26 + 2·j`); `Game.attack_fleet(1, 0)`; the box is read and left open; **No** / **Cancel** pressed (the control by its text) and the state read again; or **Yes** answered, the state read, the autosave saved (seed 1), End turn and the next autosave's news read.

## Observations

Saves (`PP_yes_seed1.SAV`, `PP_yes_seed1_AUTO0723.SAV`), the box screenshots (`peace_prompt_box_no_seed1.png`, `peace_prompt_box_cancel_seed1.png`) and `peace_prompt.json` are in the release [`run-exp-peace-prompt`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-peace-prompt) (indexed in [`evidence-index.md`](../evidence-index.md)).

| branch | seed | the box | fleets after | relations after (Carthage→Ptolemaic / back) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No | 1 | Yes / No / Cancel | unchanged (70 × 63, 90 × 74) | 1 / 1 |
| Cancel | 1 | the same | unchanged | 1 / 1 |
| Yes | 1 | the same | attacker destroyed; Carthage 90 → 72 ships, condition 74 → 60 | **3 / 3** |
| Yes | 2 | the same | attacker destroyed; Carthage 78 ships, 64 | 3 / 3 |
| Yes | 3 | the same | attacker destroyed; Carthage 78 ships, 64 | 3 / 3 |

**The relation rows** are in `peace_prompt.json` (read from game memory before and after the click, all 16 entries of Ptolemaic's and of Carthage's row): in the Yes trials Ptolemaic's row changed in two entries only, Carthage 1 → 3 and Numidia 0 → 3 (Seleucid stayed 3, Greece 1); Carthage's row has Numidia 2 (alliance), Ptolemaic 3, Celtiberia 3.

**The news** (next autosave, `PP_yes_seed1_AUTO0723.SAV`, the same three lines in seeds 2 and 3): "PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON CARTHAGE." / "PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON NUMIDIA." / "Carthage sinks fleet of Ptolemaic." The treaties: before, `Ptolemaic → {Carthage 1, Seleucid 3, Numidia 0, Greece 1, …}` and `Carthage → {Numidia 2, Seleucid 1, Greece 1, Celtiberia 3, …}`; after, `Ptolemaic → {Carthage 3, Seleucid 3, Numidia 3, Greece 1, …}`.

**The box is the same in each trial.** After No or Cancel nothing was ordered afterwards (what the selection does next was not looked at). The End turn box after Yes listed the usual army and fleet warnings.

## Inferences

- A fleet attack at trade terms is a **war declaration with a confirmation**, like the army attack on a city ([2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md](2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md)): No and Cancel are free, Yes costs the war, including **the target's allies** (Numidia here), whose own wars and alliances are then in play. The relation drops straight to war without a step through peace or hostility.
- The prompt and its news explain the cascade: a bot that wants a naval battle with a nation on trade terms should expect the war on its allies as well.

## What this does not establish

- **Other relation values:** only trade (1) was tested. Peace (0), alliance (2) and the peace-with-cooldown values (−10, −18 of the start saves) were not; an attack on an **ally** may be refused outright. Whether the ally cascade is the rule for every ally, or depends on the alliance's strength or on the attacker's own relations, is one case.
- **The box's text** is read through a garbled text read; the title and the three buttons are what is certain.
- **The cascade's reach beyond one step** (Numidia's own allies) was not read; only Ptolemaic's row of the relations was.
- **One fixture, three seeds for Yes** (in each the attacker was destroyed and Carthage's fleet was reduced, to 72 ships and condition 60 in seed 1 and to 78 and 64 in seeds 2 and 3); the effect on the AI's behaviour in the following turns (revenge, alliances called) was not followed.
- **Wine-only.**

## Reproduction

```text
setup/setup.sh
python3 -m tests.make_fleet_battle_fixture --no-war          # about 20 minutes: the trade-terms fixture
python3 runs/experiments/fleet-battles/peace_prompt.py       # No, Cancel and Yes (seed 1)
python3 runs/experiments/fleet-battles/peace_prompt.py yes --seeds 3
```

## Review notes (research repository, 2026-10-03)

- **Saves retrieved and re-read** (the release [`run-exp-peace-prompt`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-peace-prompt), with the bot's parser). `T1P_FIXTURE_fleets_adjacent.SAV` (Ptolemaic's seat, week 7): Carthage 90 ships at condition 74, Ptolemaic 70 at 63; Ptolemaic's row has Carthage 1, Numidia 0, Seleucid 3, Greece 1 and Carthage's has Numidia 2, Ptolemaic 1, Greece 1, Celtiberia 3. After the Yes (`PP_yes_seed1.SAV`): Ptolemaic's fleet is gone, Carthage's reads 72 ships and condition 60, and Ptolemaic's row has Carthage **3**, Numidia **3**, Seleucid 3, Greece 1, with Carthage→Ptolemaic and Numidia→Ptolemaic also 3. The next autosave's news ends "PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON CARTHAGE.", "PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON NUMIDIA.", "Carthage sinks fleet of Ptolemaic.". The No and Cancel trials' boxes and the unchanged state are in the draft's JSON and screenshots, not in a save, and were not re-checked.
- **The whole outcome is what the code reports predict.** Clicking an enemy fleet is `TUnitMap_SelectUnit`'s confirmation (Yes tested against `mrYes`) followed by `FUN_00449B40(you, them, 3)` ([decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md](decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md)). That setter writes both relation cells, prints "declares war on `b`" first, then, for every ally of `b` (relation 2) that the aggressor is not already at war with, writes war directly and prints one line each, **one step only** ([decompiled-war-cascade-and-peace-paths.md](decompiled-war-cascade-and-peace-paths.md)). So: Carthage first, then its only ally Numidia; Greece, on trade terms (1), is not an ally and stays 1; and the news is upper-cased because Ptolemaic is human. The draft's four-line news order and its relation rows are exactly that, which is the first live run of the cascade as well as of the fleet prompt.
- **The Yes-battle is the same battle as at war.** The three Yes trials (seeds 1, 2, 3) leave Carthage at (72, 60), (78, 64) and (78, 64); the at-war trials of the same fixture, cell P of [2026-10-02-naval-battles.md](2026-10-02-naval-battles.md) (`trials.json` of the release `run-exp-naval-battle`), give the same three results seed for seed. Declaring war inside the click therefore uses no random numbers before the battle's bonuses are drawn. The draft does not say this.
- **Nothing beyond one step was looked at**, as the draft says: Numidia's own allies would not be dragged in by the code (the cascade does not recurse), but only Ptolemaic's row was read, so that is the code's prediction here, not an observation. Other relation values (peace, alliance, the cooldown values) were not tried; an attack on an ally of the attacker may be refused, as the draft says, and the code reports do not settle it.
- **Not re-run.** No code address was re-read from the executable (no Ghidra dumps in this review).
