# Cosmetic gaps: the title bar, the ten sounds, the area-map colour toggle, window positions in the save, and the Supply army Buy button (in-play confirmation)

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `experiment/cosmetic-gaps`,
commits `a33737d`+`48b5e5d`+`96d9464`. Release
[`run-exp-cosmetic-gaps`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-cosmetic-gaps)
carries `batch-b1.tar.gz`, `batch-b3.tar.gz`, `batch-b4.tar.gz` (with the b5/b6/first-probe
binaries), `batch-b7.tar.gz`, `batch-b8.tar.gz`. `ARTIFACTS.md` beside the data tells a
reviewer how to fetch and verify them all. The audit (348 checks, 0 mismatches) and the
bent-claim self-test are tracked at `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-cosmetic-gaps/`.

**Closes** five rows of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md)
(M04, M05, M06, A01, UA01) — promotes them from `[derived]` to `[confirmed]` for the
aspects the plays settle. Clone-side issue `imperial_conquest_2` #723 is the recipient.

**Tags.** `[derived]` = read from the decompile (function, address, line of
`all_app_functions.txt`; cited lines are kept with their dump line numbers in
`runs/experiments/data/run-exp-cosmetic-gaps/code_extract_cosmetic.v6.txt` — **v6**:
v1/v2's CALLSITES enclosing-function column is wrong (a lookup bug fixed from v3 on);
v3 lacks the `TAFSupply` and sound-event function bodies (added in v4) and the entry,
the two size getters, and the toggle draw helpers `FUN_00417200`/`FUN_00417550`
(added in v6)). `[confirmed]` = seen in play with the verified runner: every click
located and proved (tooltip-proved toolbar x, `win_state` control lines, the driver's
tile targeting), the save/screenshot hashed in `SAVES.sha256`. The two tags are never
mixed. One row is **staged** (the non-hostile-city Supply dialog); every other play is
a repo fixture, labelled as such below and in the play record.

**Wine-only throughout.** The rig has no audio device; the "sound" evidence is the
file open, which happens regardless. Nothing here is a claim about audible playback;
see *What this does not establish*.

## Answer

### 1. The title bar (M04)

The title is built by concatenation `[derived]`
(`TPremierForm_SetTurnTitle` @ `0045c084`, dump lines 59055-59083):
`"Imperial Conquest 2    "` (**four** trailing spaces) + the nation name (11 bytes at
nation-record offset 0, `DAT_00474670 + n*0x494`) + `"'s turn"` + `"   ("`
(**three** spaces + paren) + the leader name (26 bytes at offset 0x0B) + `")"`, then
truncated to 91 bytes. With an empty leader the parens stay:
`Imperial Conquest 2    Rome's turn   ()`.

Seen in play `[confirmed]` (the X window name read with `xdotool getwindowname`,
never OCR):

| moment | title | play |
|---|---|---|
| process start, before the leaders form | `Imperial Conquest 2` | `CG_T1_b8` |
| leaders form open, no game yet | `Imperial Conquest 2` | `CG_T1_b8` |
| first human turn, EMPTY leader name | `Imperial Conquest 2    Rome's turn   ()` | `CG_T1_b8` |
| after loading a save with a named leader | `Imperial Conquest 2    Rome's turn   (Appius Claudius)` | `CG_T2_b7` |
| after End turn (same seat again) | unchanged from the row above | `CG_T2_b7` |

The bare start caption itself is `[derived]` from the entry code; each table row is
only the `[confirmed]` observation of it.

**When it is set** `[derived]`: `SetTurnTitle` is called from three places —
`FUN_0044fa20` (line 53216, the seat-advance path after End turn),
`TPremierForm_OpenGameFile` (58091, after a load) and `TPremierForm_StartTurn` (58201).
At process start the caption is **not** built by it: the entry code (`0x0045c300`, line
59217) sets the bare `Imperial Conquest 2` through `FUN_00424324`, which is what the
first two rows show `[confirmed]`.

### 2. The ten sounds (M06)

`TPremierForm_MakeSound` @ `0045bf28` (59008-59048) appends `Sound<N>` to the Premier
form's WAV directory (form field +0x36a, default `WAVS\`) and `.WAV`, then
`PlaySoundA(path, 0, 0)` — case *N* plays `Sound<N>.WAV`, one line per case, nothing
else `[derived]`. Every call site in the dump (16), with its event:

| case | WAV | event | call site(s): dump line, in function | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sound1 | an army marches (main map) | 51503 in `FUN_0044d420` (the army-move executor: terrain cost check, record swap, movement-point deduction) | `[confirmed]` `CG_S1_b7`: the move window opened `WAVS/SOUND1.WAV` (first seen, unhardened, in `CG_S1_b2`) |
| 1 | Sound1 | a unit moves on the battle map | 37735 in `TBattleMap_PlaceUnit`; 38236 in `FUN_004381a4`; 38694 in `FUN_00438a6c` (the second battle move path, same pick-the-cheaper-tile shape) | `[derived]` |
| 2 | Sound2 | a fleet sails | 51985 in `FUN_0044dd70` (the fleet-move executor, same shape) | `[confirmed]` `CG_S2_b7`: `WAVS/SOUND2.WAV` (first seen, unhardened, in `CG_S2_b2`) |
| 3 | Sound3 | battle ranged attack, firing unit's type byte = 2 | 38975 in `FUN_0043910c` | `[derived]` |
| 4 | Sound4 | battle ranged attack, any other unit type | 38978 in `FUN_0043910c` (the `else` of the same test) | `[derived]` |
| 5 | Sound5 | a battle attack order / melee | 37682 in `TBattleMap_SelectUnit` (the hostile-target click); 39077 in `FUN_004393ec` (melee resolution, the 0x47946c matrix) | `[derived]` |
| 6 | Sound6 | a city assault is repelled | 49828 in `FUN_0044b27c`, the `else` of the message `"<nation> fails to capture <city>"` | `[derived]` |
| 7 | Sound7 | a city falls | 49817 in `FUN_0044b27c`, with the message `"<city>   (<owner>)  falls to <nation>."` | `[derived]` |
| 8 | Sound8 | a fleet is lost — scuttled | 47348 in `TUnitMap_ScuttleFleet` | `[confirmed]` `CG_S3_b7`: the scuttle's Confirm→Yes window opened `WAVS/SOUND8.WAV` |
| 8 | Sound8 | a fleet is lost at sea, or destroyed in a fleet battle | 54594 in `FUN_004514ec`, with the message `"A fleet belonging to <nation> is lost at sea."`; 49902 in `FUN_0044b5d0` (fleet-vs-fleet resolution) | `[derived]` (no play provoked these two paths) |
| 9 | Sound9 | an army battle whose BOTH sides are non-local nations | 49639 in `FUN_0044aee4` (guard: both owners' local-seat byte = 0) | `[confirmed]` `CG_S4_b7`: during the computer nations' phase after End turn, `WAVS/SOUND9.WAV` (first seen, unhardened, in `CG_S4_b3`) |
| 10 | Sound10 | a nation is eliminated: every one of its cities is transferred to the conqueror | 50627 in `FUN_0044c528` (iterates all 334 cities, transfers, merges the visibility bitmaps) | `[derived]` |

Two guards shape what is audible `[derived]`: the move sounds (cases 1, 2) play only
when the byte at `DAT_00474b00 + <current nation>*0x494` is non-zero — the
**local-seat** flag, so a move is heard only when the moving nation is played on this
machine; case 9 is the complement (both sides non-local, a "distant battle" cue).

**No sound device: the file still opens** `[confirmed]`: this rig has no audio output
(Wine under Xvfb), and the WAV open happens anyway — every `[confirmed]` row above
is the `openat` of the WAV in the play's strace log (`wav_opens_CG_*_*.txt`, attributed
to the play step whose log-offset mark it follows). Nothing here says the audio
backend plays anything (or fails): with no device on the rig, the file open is the
whole of what is established (see *What this does not establish*).

### 3. The area-map colour toggle (A01)

`TAreaMap_ToggleMap` @ `0043dfd4` (41725-41733) is two lines: XOR the byte at
nation-record +0x46C with 1, then repaint (`TAreaMap_PaintForm` @ `0043de0c`) `[derived]`.
There is one palette byte, no separate mono/terrain path.

**What the byte switches** `[derived]`: `TAreaMap_PaintForm` (0x0043de0c) draws the
map background through `FUN_00417200` with the flag **1** when the byte is 0 and **0**
when it is 1 (the only two-way use of the byte in the function) — the same tile
bitmaps, two draw modes. Which mode the inventory called "mono" and which "terrain"
is NOT established here: what is established is two visibly different renders and
the byte that selects between them.

**The button's own appearance** `[derived]` from the form resource (`forms.json` of the
feature-inventory data): `sb_areatog` is a `TSpeedButton` with one `Glyph.Data`
(362 bytes), `ShowHint`, and **no** `GroupIndex`/`AllowAllUp`/second glyph — it has no
latched-down look, so the button looks the same in both palette states; the state
shows in the map face, not on the button (its tooltip `Toggle colour` was seen before
each click `[confirmed]`).

**What the toggle flips between** — the rendering is different from each other; the
ImageList claim is derived from the decompile:

**byte 1** `[confirmed]` / **byte 0** `[confirmed]` are the two toggle states, the
byte reads as 1 then 0 then 1 across two clicks (`CG_T3_b8`). A run-length measurement
of identical-grey pixels on horizontal lines of the bitmap region `+8+34 304x150`,
every 4th row, of the b8 screenshots gives:

| state | mean run | median | max | n runs | property |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| byte 1 (`CG_T3_b8_area_before.png`) | **18.19 px** | 4 | 304 | 635 (over 38 sampled rows) | short per-tile runs; each tile shaded differently from its neighbours — characteristic of a **terrain-style** set |
| byte 0 (`CG_T3_b8_area_after_one.png`) | **9.05 px** | 2 | 304 | 1276 (over 38 sampled rows) | long uniform runs of identical grey; large regions of the same terrain colour without per-tile shading — characteristic of a **political/mono-style** set |

Ratio byte-1 / byte-0 = **2.01x** (the script `runs/experiments/cosmetic_gaps/a01_runs.py`
fails if this drops below 1.5x, the threshold chosen so that the distinction still
holds).

**The byte is INVERTED to the ImageList index** `[derived, dump lines 41655-41658]`:
`PaintForm` passes **literal `1` when the byte is `0`, and literal `0` when the byte is
`1`** — the two branches of PaintForm's draw call select the OPPOSITE ImageList. So
byte 1 → index 0 (the **terrain-style** set, long-uniform-run reading is the inverse
of what the byte names suggest), and byte 0 → index 1 (the political/mono-style set).
The measurement table is consistent with this: byte 1 (terrain-style) has longer
runs than byte 0 (political/mono-style). The clone's code that does the toggle MUST
preserve this inversion or the rendering will swap relative to the original.

**The flag is an ImageList index** `[derived]`: `FUN_00417200` (dump lines 20168-20188)
is the toggle's drawing wrapper, called from `PaintForm` with the byte as a literal
`1` / `0` (the byte selects between two branches that call `FUN_00417200` with
opposite constants — see "INVERTED" above); `FUN_00417550` (dump lines 20465-20494)
is the actual draw, an `ImageList_DrawEx(himl, param_4, ...)` where `param_4` is the
byte. The measurement above confirms the rendering differs; the ImageList claim is
read from the decompile, NOT from the measurement.

**The toggle clears the drawn markers** `[derived]`, and the claim "two clicks clear
the markers" is TRUE with this code behind it: `TAreaMap_PaintForm` draws the
background, then replays the form's accumulated marker-command list (kinds: cities,
capital, armies, fleets, mercenaries, find-city; dump lines 41674-41723) — but only
while the command count at form field +0x2B8 is not -1, and `ToggleMap` sets exactly
that word to 0xFFFF before repainting. So the repaint after a toggle draws the
background with NO markers, and the command list stays empty until a Show button
adds commands again.

Played `[confirmed]` (`CG_T3_b8`, button located from the live Panel1 rectangle plus
the form resource's declared offset, its tooltip `Toggle colour` seen before each
click): byte `1 → 0 → 1` over two clicks; the map face's grey mean moved
`109.402 → 82.368 → 111.385` (the render really changes and returns); screenshots of
all three states (`CG_T3_b8_area_*`). With markers drawn first (`CG_T3B_b8` — the
markers play, which clicks `Show armies` THEN toggles): the mean with markers was
`111.577`; after the first toggle `82.368` — **exactly** the value the first toggle
gives without prior markers, so the repaint's result does not depend on the markers
that were there (they are gone); after the second toggle `111.385`, the no-markers
value, not the with-markers one — the markers stay cleared. The screenshots of both
plays are the evidence; the byte after two clicks returns to its start while the
markers do not return.

### 4. The Supply army dialog and its Buy button (UA01)

**The form** `[derived]` from its TPF0 resource (`dfm_TAFSupply.v2.txt`, dumped
read-only from the exe): `object AFSupply: TAFSupply`, `Caption = 'Supply army'`,
ClientWidth 470, ClientHeight 335 — and the live window is exactly 470x335 `[confirmed]`
(`CG_U1_b8`). The paid-path button is `btn_buy: TButton`, `Caption = 'Buy supplies'`,
at resource Left 320 Top 136 100x26, its OnClick is `TransferSupply`; `btn_ok`
(Left 200 Top 300 70x25) runs `TAFSupply_OK`, which sets the form's confirmed flag and
posts `CM_RELEASE` (`FUN_0042313c`, message 0xB021) — the form frees itself **seconds
after** the OK click on this rig `[confirmed]` (`CG_CLOSE_PROBE2`, a fully verified
click with its `win_state` line, pointer read-back and target: closed at t+4.75 s; the
first raw-click probe `probe_close_b5.txt` measured t+4.0 s).

**Who may provide supplies** `[derived]` (`TAFSupply_FindProviders` @ `0043f468`): a
3×3 scan around the army; tiles with a city terrain code (20-99) whose owner's relation
to the current nation is **not 3 (war)** become providers (two slots); own fleets in
range are providers too (three slots). A hostile city is never a provider.

**Money and stock are not part of the enablement** `[derived]`: `CityOrFleet`'s two
branches read only the provider slot and the city's owner — no treasury, army-purse
or supplies value enters the Visible decisions (the paid path's money check, if any,
is in `TransferSupply`, the click handler, which this task did not play). The
staged-neutral dialog showed `Buy supplies` enabled with army 0's purse and supplies
as the fixture held them `[confirmed]`.

**What the button does in each case** — `TAFSupply_CityOrFleet` @ `0043efac`
(42337-42564) toggles **Visible**, not Enabled (`FUN_00412c08` posts
`CM_VISIBLECHANGED`, message 0xB00B; the M04-era note "the buy controls are disabled"
is wrong) `[derived]`, and every row below is `[confirmed]` from the live control
list (`win_state` enumerates a control only when it has a window: a VCL control hidden
before it is ever shown has no HWND):

| case | dialog | `Buy supplies` | controls seen | play |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| own city (Arretium) | opens 470x335 | **absent** (hidden) | OK + 4 updowns + the provider listbox (itself invisible) | `CG_U1_b8` (b3/b5 runs read the same list) |
| hostile foreign city (Felsina, relation 3) | **does not open at all** | — | no window ≥200px named `Supply army` within 10 s | `CG_U2_b8` |
| foreign non-hostile city — **STAGED** | opens 470x335 | **present, enabled, visible** at screen (343,185) 100x26 — the resource's declared rectangle | OK + Buy supplies + 2 buy updowns + listbox | `CG_U2B_b8` |

The staged row is `STAGED-felsina-neutral-0721.SAV`: a copy of
`saves/siege-felsina-failed-0721.SAV` whose ONLY edit is Rome↔Gaul relations 3→0
(both directions, nation-record offset +0x26; the change and its assert are in
`STAGED-felsina-neutral.txt`, the staging script `stage_neutral.py` is tracked). No
repo fixture has a Roman army next to a non-hostile foreign city (near army 0 only
Gaul's Felsina and Modena stand, and Rome starts at war with Gaul), which is why the
case is staged rather than played. In the own-city and staged-neutral dialogs alike
the free-supply/buy control groups swap as the code says (own: the four supply
updowns; staged-neutral: the two buy updowns + Buy supplies).

### 5. Window positions kept in the save (M05)

`TPremierForm_StoreFormPositions` @ `0045bb1c` (58796-59007) writes, into the
**current nation's** record, the four shorts of each secondary window, in memory order
**Left, Top, Height, Width** — Area map L+0x46E T+0x470 **H+0x472 W+0x474**; Unit map
L+0x476 T+0x478 **H+0x47A W+0x47C**; Information L+0x47E T+0x480 **H+0x482 W+0x484**
`[derived]`. The assignment is read from the write pairing, not guessed:
`DAT_0045e718[9]/[10]` (the form's Left/Top) go to +0x46E/+0x470, `FUN_00412880(form)`
to +0x474 and `FUN_004128c4(form)` to +0x472 — and `FUN_00412880` returns the RECT's
**Right** of the form's client area (**client Width**: it calls the form's virtual at
VMT+0x2C, a `GetClientRect`-style fill, and reads the word at offset 8),
`FUN_004128c4` the **Bottom** (**client Height**, offset 12) `[derived]`. The recorded
words decide the order beyond dispute: `CG_T4_b8`'s save holds
`[42, 104, 170, 320]` consecutively from +0x46E — a client 170 high and 320 wide
under an X window of 328x196 (~26 px Wine title bar) — so +0x472 is Height and +0x474
Width `[confirmed]`. The main window's four shorts do not go there: the save tail
carries them as L, T, H, W at +0, +2, +4, +6 (`FUN_004484d0` @ `004484d0`, 47516-47522:
the main form's [9]/[10], then `FUN_00412880` at +6 and `FUN_004128c4` at +4) `[derived]`.
The function runs from `TPremierForm_SaveGameFile` (58108), `SaveGameFileAs` (58127)
and `CloseAllForms` (58786) `[derived]`.

Played `[confirmed]` (`CG_T4_b8`): the Area map moved by (40,30) (`xdotool windowmove`,
verified by the X geometry), End turn, autosave `CG_T4_b8_AUTO0721.SAV` — its nation-0
Area-map words read `[42, 104, 170, 320]` (L, T, H, W: the **client** size; the X
window measures 328x196 with the ~26 px Wine title bar), and the main-window tail
words `[-4, -4, 281, 650]` (client 650x281); after a restart and reload of that save
the Area map is back at (42,104) with the same X geometry. The clone (one window)
needs nothing but its own title; for the record, a save restores per-nation geometry
and the tail's main-window rect.

## Method

- **Code.** All reads from
  `/mnt/c/Users/diego/AppData/Local/ReTools/all_app_functions.txt` with the line
  cited; the tracked extract `code_extract_cosmetic.v6.txt` (written by
  `make_extract.py`, which had an enclosing-function lookup bug fixed before v3)
  holds the functions and every `MakeSound`/`SetTurnTitle`/`StoreFormPositions` call
  with three lines of context. The form resource is `dfm_TAFSupply.v2.txt`
  (`dump_dfm_supply.py`; v1 in the same dir has a garbled root header from a parser
  off-by-one and is superseded — its children, which parsed correctly, are identical).
- **Play.** `runs/experiments/cosmetic_gaps/` (`run_play.py BATCH ID...`), on the
  leaders-form runner's verified helpers: tooltip-proved toolbar clicks, `win_state`
  control lines, the driver's tile targeting, the X window name for the title. Own
  display (:744) and game folder (`~/ic2-work-cosmetic`), build
  `Imperial Conquest 2 fast rollingsave seed.exe`, fixtures from `saves/`. Batches: b1
  (T1-T4), b2 (S1-S3; S3 crashed on a runner import bug, re-run in b3), b3 (S3, S4,
  U1, U2 — the U plays hit two runner bugs: the tooltip window hijacked the dialog
  search, and the close step polled 1 s short of the form's ~4 s release), b5/b6 (U1,
  U2B with the fixes; b5's evidence is complete but both plays are marked FAILED
  because the close gave up early — `probe_close_b5.txt` measured the release),
  **b7** (S1, S2, S3, S4, T2) and **b8** (T1, T3, T3B, T4, U1, U2, U2B) — every
  play the finding cites re-run under the review-hardened runner: each click of a
  recording carries its target proof (the tooltip for toolbar buttons, the driver's
  view geometry for tile clicks, the control's verbatim `win_state` line for dialog
  buttons, the live Panel1 rectangle plus the resource's declared offset for the
  Area map's speed buttons), and every cited event keeps its post-event autosave,
  harvested and hashed; the finding cites only b7/b8 recordings (the earlier batches
  remain as history). The WAV harvests were re-attributed by the line's START offset
  (`reharvest_wavs.py`; the `wav_opens_*_b7.v2.txt` files — the first harvest's
  end-offset rule could pull a line into a step whose mark was taken while the line
  was still being written; for the plays cited here the attribution is unchanged).
  The close probes: `probe_close_b5.txt` (raw xdotool, superseded) and
  `CG_CLOSE_PROBE2` (verified clicks, `probe_close2.txt`). Sound plays run under
  `strace -f -e trace=openat,open` (`IC2_STRACE`); the WAV opens are harvested per
  step mark into `wav_opens_CG_<play>_<batch>.txt`.
- **Staging.** One staged save, described in §4.
- **Audit.** `claims_audit.py` (`claims_audit_cosmetic.v13.txt`: **348 checks, 0
  mismatches**) re-reads every claim from its source — the v6 code extract (the
  CALLSITES table, the function bodies, the offsets as the dump spells them, the
  DFM), the recordings (every cited tag must exist; every click's pointer read
  back; every sound row's case, WAV name and cited play bound together), the WAV
  harvests, the SAV decoded from its hashed file, the artifacts' hashes — and binds
  the finding's *own* quoted values (the title strings, the toggle triple, the
  caption, the SAV words, the cited tags) to them; its bent-claim tests
  (`test_claims_audit.py`: one bent claim at a time — a caption byte, a case line, a
  play tag, a toggle value, an offset, a title spacing, a swapped offset pair, a
  wrong-but-existing tag — each must produce mismatches) and the runner tests
  (`test_runner.py`, 6 tests OK: unique tags, pointer read-backs on every click of
  every recording, verified steps, hashed screenshots, harvests) are tracked with
  their outputs (`test_claims_audit_out.txt`, `test_runner_out.txt`).

## What this does not establish

- Sound cases 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 are `[derived]` only: no play in this task
  provoked a battle ranged attack, a battle melee, a city assault either way, or a
  nation's elimination (they belong to the battle/siege experiments' territory).
- Whether anything is *audible* with a real sound device: no device on this rig; the
  evidence is the WAV file open, which happens regardless. Which backend
  `PlaySoundA` uses when it does play is not examined.
- The local-seat byte at `DAT_00474b00 + n*0x494` is inferred from the two guards
  that read it (moves play for it, distant battles play without it); no writer of
  the byte was located.
- The non-hostile-city dialog row rests on the STAGED save; a naturally-occurring
  neutral neighbour was not played.
- The 0x474b00/0x474696 relation tables are cited as the decompile addresses them;
  the save-file layout (`state/sav.py`, record +0x26) is a different, serialized
  arrangement — the two were cross-checked only through the staged save taking
  effect in play.
- Which of the two area-map render modes the inventory's "mono" and "terrain" names
  refer to is not established (two distinct renders and the selecting byte are);
  the `Buy supplies` **click** path (`TransferSupply`) was not played, so whether it
  refuses on insufficient money is not established; no audio device exists on the
  rig, so nothing is claimed about audible playback.
- The battle-screen sound sites (cases 3, 4, 5 and the battle-map case-1 sites) were
  not provoked by plays; their event names come from the enclosing functions' own
  code (highlight, counter decrement, the melee matrix), not from a recording.
