# Victory and defeat (V01–V05) and End-of-game screens (EG01) — verification

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`6aa10fd8161d674dab4e90e779cfa908705614e0` (short `6aa10fd`, captured
post-push by `git log -1 origin/main --format=%H`; the relay's SHA
citation matches the on-`main` commit). Release
`run-exp-feature-inventory`, asset `FI_batch1_screenshots.tar.gz`.

**Closes** the cell-level verification of V01–V05 and EG01 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
Six rows that close the 146-row inventory. V01–V05 share
`THumanFalls_InitializeForm @ 0x00455e38` (the *End of Game* form
initialiser); EG01 is the form itself. One consolidated draft.

**Tag policy:** All `[derived]` (the End-of-game screen is opened only
when one of these triggers fires; `coverage.md §4` not yet seen for
this section). Carried from the inventory.

## Answer — per-row sources

**V01 — Victory: all 334 cities** | The game ends with *"You have
conquerred the Mediterranean, a unique achievement."* when the nation
holds all 334 cities | `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` **row 384**
reproduces the literal at `THumanFalls_InitializeForm 0x00455e38`.
`X:THumanFalls_InitializeForm` (cities test against 334);
`X:FUN_00452034` (the cities-count test fired at every human turn
start).
[`R:decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md`](decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md)
'Victory condition'. `H:'Victory'`. coverage.md §4 `Victory` —
`[not yet seen]` per the inventory's row prose. `[derived]`.

**V02 — End of the allotted 20 years** | At 250 BC the game ends with
*"You have reached the end of your allotted 20 years."* |
`dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` **row 379** reproduces the literal at
`THumanFalls_InitializeForm 0x00455e38`. `X:THumanFalls_InitializeForm`
(year compared with 250); `X:FUN_00452034` (tested at every human turn
start).
[`R:decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md`](decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md).
`H:'Time' (Conquest must end by 250 BC)`. `[derived]`.

**V03 — Conquered** | A human nation with no cities left sees
*"Your nation has been conquerred by <nation>."* and the seat turns
computer-controlled | `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` **row 382**
reproduces the literal up to the trailing space (the `<nation>` is
appended at runtime from the conqueror's name —
`TInformation_ShowNationStatus @ 0x0043ba7c` carries the equivalent
panel text at row 104 `" conquerred by "`). `X:THumanFalls_InitializeForm
@ 0x00455e38`, `X:TPremierForm_HumanLeaderFalls @ 0x0045c238`.
[`R:decompiled-elimination-cleanup.md`](decompiled-elimination-cleanup.md)
§3. coverage.md §4 `Conquest` — `[not yet seen]`. `[derived]`.

**V04 — Deposed by the army** | *"Your unpopularity has forced the
army to overthrow you."* when unity is below 400, otherwise *"Your
army have deposed you because they have not been paid."* (debt); the
game ends for that seat and it turns computer-controlled |
`dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` **rows 380 + 381** reproduce both
literals at `THumanFalls_InitializeForm 0x00455e38`. Test: treasury
below `-(wealth div 500)` or below -20,000, or unity below 400, run
at the start of each human turn (not conquered, not 250 BC).
`X:THumanFalls_InitializeForm`, `X:FUN_0044c8f0` (the deposit-leader
dispatcher — also cited in the E16 quarterly-tick row).
[`R:upkeep-payment-and-desertion.md`](upkeep-payment-and-desertion.md)
'Debt and deposition'. `H:'Balance sheet' (debt limit)`. `[derived]`.

**V05 — Survival and peaceful targets** | Help states only one sure
way to win (dominate the Mediterranean) and no difficulty level;
players set their own targets | `H:'Victory'`. `[derived]` carry-over
(no save diff exercises this — purely a help-text claim).

**EG01 — End of Game screen** | Window *"End of Game"*: the reason, the
leader's years in power and a start-versus-end table of population,
cities and money; OK closes and the seat is handed over (or the game
ends when no human is left) | form `THumanFalls` (in `forms.json`);
`THumanFalls_InitializeForm @ 0x00455e38` (the form-init populating
`lbl_result1` / `lbl_result2` / `lbl_changes` / `lbl_nat1..2` /
`lbl_pop1..2` / `lbl_cities1..2` / `lbl_money1..2` / `OK` per the
inventory); `X:THumanFalls_InitializeForm`, `X:THumanFalls_OK`.
[`R:decompiled-elimination-cleanup.md`](decompiled-elimination-cleanup.md)
§3. coverage.md §4 `End of Game` — `[not yet seen]`. `[derived]`.

## Three open notes

1. **V01–V04 are `[not yet seen]` per `coverage.md §4`** (the inventory
   carries this verbatim). They are not in the live-save evidence path
   because the End-of-Game screen is reachable only when one of the
   four triggers fires. Reproducing V01 requires 334-city ownership (a
   long game); V02 requires the year reaching 250 BC (also long); V03
   requires the human nation to be eliminated (mid-game); V04 requires
   the unity or treasury gate to fire (mid-game). None of these are in
   the `runs/` directory's tracked live tests.
2. **V03's `<nation>` placeholder** is appended at runtime from the
   conqueror's nation record; the `THumanFalls_InitializeForm
   @ 0x00455e38` literal is *"Your nation has been conquerred by "*
   (trailing space), and the runtime then writes the conqueror's name.
   Reproduction would need a save pair where the human is conquered;
   the literal text up to the conqueror name is the cell-level pinning.
3. **EG01's exact label strings** (`lbl_result1`/`lbl_result2`/
   `lbl_changes`/etc.) are form-level TPF0 captions that live in
   `forms.json` for the `THumanFalls` form. Cell-level reproduction
   would pin those captions verbatim; the inventory's evidence row
   already lists the labels.

## Inferences

- **The four outcome-panel literals are all in one function
  (`THumanFalls_InitializeForm`)** at address `0x00455e38`. A
  reproduction can wire one form-init that branches by the trigger
  (cities == 334 → V01; year == 250 → V02; nationsEliminated → V03;
  unity < 400 or treasury < threshold → V04) and emits the
  corresponding literal.
- **EG01 is the form that displays them** — the labels
  (`lbl_result1`/`lbl_result2`/`lbl_changes`/etc.) are the *frame*, the
  four-literal set is the *content*. Capturing both is enough to render
  the End-of-Game screen.
- **Cross-row reuse:** `FUN_00452034` is the per-human-turn-start
  check (cities + year); cited in both V01 and V02. `FUN_0044c8f0` is
  the deposit-leader dispatcher — also cited in the E16
  quarterly-tick row.

## What this does not establish

- Live-save test for V01–V04 (open note 1).
- V03's runtime conqueror-name substitution (open note 2).
- EG01's per-label TPF0 captions verbatim (open note 3).

## Reproduction

```bash
cd ~/projects/ic2-conquest
grep -E "THumanFalls_InitializeForm|TPremierForm_HumanLeaderFalls|FUN_00452034|FUN_0044c8f0" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/function_list.tsv
grep -nE "allotted 20 years|unpopularity has forced|deposed you because|Your nation has been conquerred|conquerred the Mediterranean" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/dump_string_literals.v2.tsv
# form roster (29 forms total expected):
python3 -c 'import json; print(len(json.load(open("runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/forms.json"))))'
```

The form, function and literal extracts are deterministic. Re-running
`tests/test_orders.py` does not reach any of V01–V04 — those triggers
are game-end conditions, not in the coverage.md test set.
