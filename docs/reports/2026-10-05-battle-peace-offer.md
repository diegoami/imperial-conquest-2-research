# The post-battle "Offer of peace" (`TBattlePols`, battles plan B16): when it opens, what Yes and No do, and the gate measured

**Status:** promoted from the `ic2-conquest` draft of the same name (merged to `main` as `0df8cce`, PR #45; **generated from `findings/b16-finding.skeleton.md`, which is its template and not a finding**); needed by the clone's task T139. **Wine-only: every observed result is a candidate until the desktop original confirms it.** Data: `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-battle-peace/`; saves, snapshots and screenshots: release [`run-exp-battle-peace`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-battle-peace) (611 binaries, `SAVES.v3.sha256`).


> **Checked here against the decompiled rules:** the gate (armies(W) < armies(L), unity(L) > 500, cities(L) > 7, then `Random(5) < 2`, drawn only if the three pass, at `0x45951C`) is [decompiled-war-cascade-and-peace-paths.md](decompiled-war-cascade-and-peace-paths.md) (the `0x004594E6`-`0x00459524` listing) and [decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md](decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md); Yes setting the human-AI war relation to -18 is the report's "post-battle treaty" path (row 3), and the -18 to -14 step on the next End turn is its quarterly thaw (cooldown toward 0, `FUN_00451B40`); the reseed value `0x3033181F` equals one generator step from seed 0 + 6 (`6 x 0x08088405 + 1`, computed here). **Not checked here:** the 12 Yes/No pairs, the 42-field full-save diff, the 10-of-30 open rate, the 45-claim audit; no saves or snapshots re-read, they stand as the bot's figures.

## Answer

- **The box exists and has one shape [O].** Title `Offer of peace`, 406 x 360 at (13, 94), 2 controls, both `TButton`s, `Yes` and `No` (the text is painted, so it is read from the screenshot). Text after a human defeat: "After defeating you in battle Gaul are willing to end their war with you, if you agree to the terms below. An honourable peace with no reparations or penalt[ies] If the peace terms are acceptable click YES. Otherwise to continue the war click NO." After a human victory the first words are "After losing to you in battle Gaul are willing to end their war with you" (`win-own126,strong126,unity6600,weak2500,weak13500_s3_survey_r1_dialog-Offer_of_peace-*.png`). Both match the report's wordings. The reparation lines are empty in every box seen (no digit appears in any box text).
- **Open rate [O], normal build, D-LOSS (Rome's army 0 = one 3,000 LI battalion, Computer general on both sides): 10 of 30 seeds** (seeds 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 18, 28, 30), 33 %. In all 30 the three tests of `[R-code]` (armies(W) < armies(L), unity(L) > 500, cities(L) > 7) hold (all hold: True), so the rate is that of the draw alone. **D-WIN (Gaul's army 10 = one 3,000 LI battalion): 0 of 10**, and its tests fail (armies(Gaul) = 0 after its army is deleted, Gaul's unity 377).
- **D-WIN can be made to open [O], with an L1 edit:** Illyria's army 12 given to Gaul (`owner`, nation 6) and made 6 HI battalions of 6,000, Gaul's unity 600, Rome's armies 2 and 13 cut to one 500 LI battalion each, read back from memory before each run: the tests then hold (armies(Rome) 11,775 to 11,839 < armies(Gaul) 29,700, Gaul unity 575 after the -25, 23 cities) and the box opened in **2 of 5 seeds** (3 and 5).
- **Yes versus No [O], 12 pairs (10 D-LOSS seeds, 2 D-WIN-with-second-army seeds), the same save and seed in two fresh processes:** the state before the answer is identical (below), the click was verified (Yes in one, No in the other, box closed), and then: **Rome-Gaul relation -18 in both directions after Yes, 3 (war) after No. Over the whole decoded save (map, cities, armies, fleets, nations, mercenaries, news) the only changes between the state with the box up and the save right after Yes are those 2 relation words and one news line appended ("Gaul and Rome have agreed to end their war.", the oldest line dropped); after No no decoded field changes** (recomputed in the audit from the snapshots and saves, 24 runs; the save's tail, i.e. calendar, turn order, current seat, pending offer and battle flag, is not in the memory snapshot and was compared only between the Yes and No saves, where it is equal). On the next End turn the -18 becomes -14 and stays -14 through turn 4. After No the war goes on: **in the D-LOSS pairs Gaul takes one Rome city per End turn from turn 2 (Rome 30, 29, 28, 27 cities after each turn up to turn 4; Gaul 23 to 26), after Yes Rome keeps 30**; in the D-WIN pairs nobody takes a city in 4 turns (Rome 30, Gaul 23).
- **No v No is byte-identical [O]** on 2 seeds (1 and 3): the post-answer save and all 4 End-turn autosaves (post-answer save equal: True; turn saves equal: True). There is **no run-to-run noise** on the normal build, so every Yes/No difference is caused by the answer; the answer includes the RNG stream (a Yes calls the treaty routine, which reseeds and draws, `[R-code]`), so other nations' relations and the mercenary offers differ from the first End turn on [D].
- **The gate against `[R-code]` [O]:** the loser's unity **501 opens, 500 does not** (3 seeds each; unity is read after the battle's -25, so the loser needs more than 525 before it); the loser's city-count word **8 opens, 7 does not**; Rome's other armies cut so that armies(Rome) 127 < armies(Gaul) (12,934 to 12,992 over the seeds) **does not open** (`loss+weak2=500,weak13=500`: armies(L), Rome the loser, is 127 against armies(W), Gaul, 12,934 to 12,992, so the test `armies(W) < armies(L)` fails). With the B11 exchange hook on 16 hooked lab seeds the box opens **exactly when the logged `Random(5)` at `0x45951c` is below 2** (3 opens, draws 0, 1, 0; 13 closed, draws 2 to 4), and **no draw is made at all when a test fails** (9 hooked runs with unity 500, 7 cities or weak armies: 0 records at `0x45951c`). So the condition `[R-code]` gives is **measured, not only uncontradicted**, for the three tests as thresholds and for the draw; not measured: equality of both army sums, human-human, and the treaty's ally loop (below).

## For the clone: the facts to copy (each recomputed by the audit from raw data and rendered from this skeleton)

1. **The box.** Window title `Offer of peace`, 406 x 360 at (13, 94) in the game window's coordinates, 2 buttons `Yes` and `No` (class `TButton`; 70 x 25 each; Yes at box-relative (81, 320), No at (256, 320), from the `controls` records). Text, painted: "After defeating you in battle <Winner> are willing to end their war with you, if you agree to the terms below." (human defeated) or "After losing to you in battle <Loser> are willing to end their war with you, if you agree to the terms below." (human won); then "An honourable peace with no reparations or penalt[ies]" (the box clips the line), empty reparation lines (never filled), "If the peace terms are acceptable click YES." and "Otherwise to continue the war click NO." It opens after the "Battle ended" box's OK, modal.
2. **Yes.** Relation between both nations set to **-18** in both directions; news line **"<Winner> and <Loser> have agreed to end their war."** ("Gaul and Rome have agreed to end their war." after a human defeat, "Rome and Gaul have agreed to end their war." after a human victory, the oldest of the 40 news lines dropped); **no other change** at the answer (full before/after diff of the decoded save: only the 2 relation words and the news ring change; money, unity, city count, armies, fleets, mercenaries and the map do not); on the **next End turn -18 becomes -14** (quarterly thaw) and stays -14 over the following turns up to turn 4. Yes also reseeds and draws (`[R-code]`): other nations' relations and mercenary offers then differ from the No branch from the next turn on.
3. **No.** No decoded field changes (full before/after diff, 12 runs): the relation stays **3 (war)** and the war goes on (in the staged D-LOSS position Gaul then takes one Rome city per End turn from turn 2).
4. **The gate, as measured.** The box opens in a human-AI battle only if, after the battle's write-back (winner unity +25, loser -25): **armies(W) < armies(L)** (sum of field strength of each nation's live armies; Rome 32,743 v Gaul 12,934 to 13,050 opens, 127 v 12,934 to 12,992 does not), **unity(L) > 500** (501 opens, 500 does not), **cities(L) > 7** (the city-count word: 8 opens, 7 does not); **then a draw `Random(5)` at `0x45951c` must be below 2** (hooked: draws 0, 1, 0 opened, 2 to 4 did not; no draw is made at all when a test fails). Any of the three tests failing means no box and no draw. Rate with the tests met: 10 of 30 seeds (33 %); 2 of the 5 values of the draw open it (40 %).
5. **The reseed.** When the box opens the game sets `RandSeed := winner + loser`: read with the box up, `RandSeed` is **`0x3033181F`** in every opened run (one step of the generator after the seed 0 + 6: Rome is nation 0, Gaul 6), whatever the seed, and a hooked reseed record at `0x457907` marks it. Everything after the box starts from that stream.

## Method

- **Build:** the NORMAL build, `Imperial Conquest 2 fast rollingsave seed.exe` (`RandSeed` from `SEED.TXT` at program start; `Game.load(save, seed)` = a fresh process, then File > Open), as battles plan §7 asks. One process per run, on private displays and game folders (never the shared ones). The hooked runs use `lab hook s<seed>` (PR #42, `setup/build_lab_exes.sh --hook`; SHA-256 in `EXES-hook-sha256*.txt`): the lab build reseeds at every battle start, so a hooked seed is **not** the normal build's seed of the same number.
- **Start:** `FLD-RG_0743_rome_army0_at_86_28.SAV` (Rome's army 0 at (86, 28) next to Gaul's army 10 at (85, 28); Rome 30 cities, unity 881; Gaul 23 cities, unity 402; Rome's other armies 2 and 13). Cells are **L1 synthetic edits** (`stage.py`, positions never edited): `loss` = army 0 one LI battalion of 3,000, quality 6; `win` = army 10 the same; `win+own12=6,strong12=6,unity6=600,weak2=500,weak13=500` = `win` with army 12 (Illyria's, nation 9, at (150, 61), far from the battle) given to Gaul and made 6 HI battalions of 6,000, Gaul's unity 600, Rome's armies 2 and 13 one 500 LI battalion each; gate cells = `loss` plus `unity0=<v>`, `ncities0=<v>` (the count word at nation `+0x446`, equal to the length of the city list in the start save: True; the list is not edited) or `weak2=500,weak13=500`. **Every extra edit is read back from game memory before the attack** (`readback` in `trials-b16.jsonl`); a mismatch is an error record. Both sides on Computer general.
- **A run (`b16_run.py`):** load, read back, Rome's army 0 attacks Gaul's army 10, `play_battle(on_dialog=..., pre_answer=...)`. **The state before the answer is read from game memory while the box is up and before the click** (`0x45E030..0x4A0B80`: `RandSeed`, the map, the nation, army, fleet tables, the battle block and header, 273,232 bytes, `<trial>_pre.snap.gz`); a run whose box does not open gets the same read right after the Battle ended box closed. The box is answered through the new **`Game.answer_battle_peace(yes)`**: it reads the text (OCR) and the controls, requires both buttons, checks that the click point lies inside the wanted button and outside the other, clicks, re-clicks the same button if the box is open after 2.5 s (at most 3 clicks), and raises unless the box closed. The click and the closing are in every record (`answered`, `answer_click`): on the normal build 32 No and 12 Yes answers took 2 clicks each, and 1 early No answer took 3 (the first click only activates the window). **A Yes or a No is recorded from the click, never inferred from the outcome.** `No` runs of a pair use the driver's `capture` mode (screenshot and controls kept, then No).
- **A pair:** the same save and seed once per answer, Yes in one run and No in the other; after the answer a Save As (`<trial>_post.SAV`), then **4 strategic End turns, each proven** (`end_turn(reclick=False)`: no second click without a sign of the turn starting; the "army needs supplies" box answered End turn; 0 turn errors), each autosave copied (`turns/`), Rome and Gaul read from memory, the news boxes OCR'd, a screenshot of the screen (the Information panel holds the news).
- **Error records:** 1 in `trials-b16.jsonl`: `loss_s5_hook-capture_r1` (the lab hook exe for that seed had not been built yet; kept, the seed was rerun as `r2`). Survey trials killed by an early stop wrote no record; they were rerun.
- **Output rule (rule 6):** `trials-b16.jsonl` is append-only; every table is a new file (`b16-survey-table-*.csv`, `b16-pairs-*.json`, `b16-pairs-summary-*.csv`, `b16-repeat-*.json`, `b16-hook-table-*.csv`, `hooklog-*.csv`); nothing was deleted; an earlier run that was superseded (`loss_s1_no_r1`, the first No of its seed, which recorded no screenshot) stays and is used as a repeat.
- **Audit:** `b16_audit.py` recomputes this finding's numbers from the raw snapshots, saves and screenshots (`b16-claims-audit-*.md`); the audit reads no analyser output (header of `b16_raw.py`).

## Observations

### The identity of a pair's state before the answer [O]
For all 12 pairs the pre-answer snapshots of Yes and No are equal **except at most 2 bytes, one in each of the words at `0x45E614` and `0x45E616`** (all differences inside them: True), and the text, controls, geometry and screenshot of the box are byte-identical (the PNGs are equal: True). Those words (values 74 to 92 and 1 or 2) are not game state: they vary from run to run for the same save, seed and answer (`loss_s8_survey_r1`, `loss_s8_yes_r1`, `loss_s8_no_r1` hold 78, 76 and 74), and they lie outside every table and the battle block. Between runs of different roles (a survey run and a pair run) up to 10 more bytes of the same area `0x45E420..0x45E480` differ; **in no comparison does any named region differ** (`RandSeed`, map, nations, armies, fleets and news area, battle block, battle header: 19 comparisons, all equal: True; the pairs, all equal: True). The title text read when the battle window opens ("Rome to place units" or "Gaul to place units") is a poll-time read and differed in one pair; the memory state does not. `RandSeed` read at the box is the same value, `0x3033181F`, in every opened run (44 runs; the reseed at `0x457907` `winner + loser`, then the preview's draw), so the stream after the box does not depend on the seed.

(`armies(W)`, `armies(L)` are the sums of field strength over each nation's live armies read from the snapshot, the quantity `FUN_0044A8CC` sums; unity and cities are the loser's.)

The audit lays the blocks of the memory snapshot taken with the box up (map, cities, armies, fleets, nations, mercenaries and the news ring) over the post-answer save, decodes both with `state/sav.py` and compares every decoded field (`b16_raw.fulldiff_raw`; the analyser `b16_fulldiff.py` is only compared with it). **No branch changes anything else:** in the 12 Yes runs exactly 42 decoded fields change per run, the 2 relation words (`nations[0].relations.Gaul and nations[6].relations.Rome`, 3 to -18) and 40 news positions, which is 1 line appended ("Gaul and Rome have agreed to end their war." after a human defeat, "Rome and Gaul have agreed to end their war." after a human victory) and the oldest line ("Laranda   (Seleucid)  falls to Galatia.") dropped from the 40-line ring; no map cell (0 changed), city, army, fleet, mercenary or other nation field changes. In the 12 No runs 0 fields change. Not compared before/after: the save's tail (calendar, turn order, current seat, pending offer, battle flag) and the battle block, which are not in the snapshot; the Yes and No post-answer saves are equal in the tail.

### Repeatability [O]
Normal build, same save, same seed, different process: `loss_s1_{capture,survey,no_r1,no_r2}` are equal in every named region and in the post-answer save, and the repeated No runs of seeds 1 and 3 are **byte-identical in the post-answer save and in all 4 End-turn autosaves** (post-answer save equal: True; turn saves equal: True). So no lab build was needed for the pairs.

## Inferences

- **[D] Why the 10 D-LOSS pairs look alike.** The box reseeds `RandSeed := winner + loser` when it opens (`0x457907`, hooked records `loss_s10_hook-capture_r1` etc.), so everything after the box starts from the same stream whatever the seed; the seeds differ only in the battle's survivors (the post-answer saves of seeds 1 and 30 differ in 6 bytes, the turn-4 autosaves in 7). The 10 pairs are therefore close replicates of one post-battle situation, not independent samples of the strategic aftermath; they are independent samples of the open/closed draw and of the identity proof.
- **[D] Yes writes the relation and the news and nothing else.** The full before/after diff of the 12 Yes runs shows only the 2 relation words and the news ring changing; the Yes and No post-answer saves differ in no other non-news field either. The report's "honourable peace with no reparations" matches: no money moved.
- **[D] The -14 on the next turn** fits the quarterly thaw of a negative relation that the report gives (+1, and +3 with a 1-in-3 chance, the rule is the report's, not measured here) acting on -18 (a step of 4); it stays -14 over the next End turns, consistent with no further quarter boundary in them.
- **[D] After No Gaul keeps attacking Rome in the D-LOSS cell** because Rome's armies are weak there; that Gaul takes a city a turn is a property of this staged position (Rome's army 0 gone, Gaul's army 10 adjacent), not a rate.
- **[R-code] and [O].** Measured: the draw is `Random(5)` (range 5 logged in all 16 hooked runs), the box opens exactly when it is < 2 (checked on every hooked run: True), it is drawn only when the three tests pass, and the tests' thresholds are strict (`unity > 500`, `cities > 7`, `armies(W) < armies(L)` at its extremes).

## What this does not establish

- **Wine-only.** The desktop original was not run.
- **Computer general on both sides**, no human-clicked battle. Whether a battle the human plays differently reaches the same box is not tested.
- **One geometry.** Rome v Gaul at (86, 28) / (85, 28), Rome's army 0 or Gaul's army 10 reduced to one 3,000 LI battalion (L1 synthetic). The 33 % open rate is that of the draw at this geometry and does not depend on anything else here; it is not a property of every battle. The D-WIN opening needs the second-Gaul-army edit (an existing army re-owned, positions and map untouched; the unit map's marker for army 12 was not looked at), and its 2 of 5 is a small sample.
- **The normal build for pairs, the lab hook build for the draw.** The hooked seeds are lab seeds; the pairing "this seed's draw" is not carried over to the normal build's seeds.
- **4 End turns only**, and a position in which Rome's relations with its allies were not part of the question: the ally loop of the treaty (`rel[W][k] == 2 and rel[L][k] == 3`, ally relations to -8) was not exercised (no case has Rome or Gaul with an ally at war with the other).
- **Not tested:** `armies(W)` equal to `armies(L)`; unity or city counts between the pairs of thresholds tested (501/500, 8/7); human against human (`THVHBatPols`); more than one box in a turn; what a Yes does when the loser is the AI and the human the winner beyond the 2 D-WIN pairs (relation -18, no other non-news field differs).
- The **volatile words** at `0x45E614`/`0x45E616` were not identified; they are excluded from the identity proof.

## Claims audit
`b16-claims-audit-*.md` (written by `runs/experiments/battles/b16_audit.py`; the newest file is the one cited; older audit files are kept) renders this finding from the skeleton and the raw data and fails unless both are equal; it recomputes the full before/after diff (news included) and the repeat comparisons itself and only compares the analysers' files with its own numbers; it also checks every cited file and cell for existence. The older `SAVES.sha256` mixes name forms (the runner's bare names, and `shots/...`-prefixed names after one run of `scripts/archive_measurements.py`); it is not edited, and `SAVES.v3.sha256` lists every binary once as `<sha256>  <bare file name>`.
