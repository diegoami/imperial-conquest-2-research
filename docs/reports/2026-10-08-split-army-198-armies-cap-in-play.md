# Split army: the 198-army cap in play (row L11, 198 armies)

Companion to the inventory rows L11 and UA04
([`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md))
and to R01 in [`2026-10-05-refusal-texts-and-conditions.md`](2026-10-05-refusal-texts-and-conditions.md),
which read the gate from the code ("nothing happens, no box").

**Review note:** the gate line L48725 `(-1 < (short)local_12) && (DAT_004a0324 < 0xc6)`
matches the quotation already in R01/R49 and in
[`decompiled-mobilization-and-mercenary-restock.md`](decompiled-mobilization-and-mercenary-restock.md).
The full `code_extract_rework_extra.txt` dump was not available on the reviewing
machine, so the call order at :47046-47048 (`FUN_00449f08` before the dialog) was
not re-read here. The live 197 → 198 count when the dialog opens agrees with it.

**Tag:** `[confirmed, partial]` for the 198-armies bullet of L11, tested on Split
army only. The same helper `FUN_00449f08` also gates Mobilize (R49) and new armies
from recruitment, and those paths were not run.

## Answer

- The cap counts **every nation's armies together**. It is the game's army count `DAT_004a0324` (memory 0x4A0324, the save's army count at offset 100,956), not a per-nation count.
- `TUnitMap_SplitArmy` (0x0044755C) calls `FUN_00449f08` **before** it opens the dialog (`code_extract_rework_extra.txt` :47046-47048). `FUN_00449f08` creates the new record only when `DAT_004a0324 < 0xc6` (:48725), so the record is taken (count + 1) as soon as the dialog opens.
- **197 armies:** Split army opens its dialog (610×430) and the count goes from 197 to 198 at once.
- **198 armies:** nothing happens. No dialog and no box appear, the count stays at 198 and army 0 keeps its 6 units. The save shows 198 armies.

| Total armies before | Dialog | Count after the click | Result |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 197 | opens (610×430) | 198 | accepted |
| 198 | none (only the button's 51×15 tooltip) | 198 | refused silently |

Evidence: `T_SPLIT_198_ARMIES.SAV` (sha256 `af56f25bbfae35f7…`), `probe-197-after-split-click.png`, `probe-198-after-split-click.png` (release `run-exp-l11-198-armies`); `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-l11-198-armies/` (`test_run_1.log`, `test_run_2.log`, `probe.log`, `probe198.py`, `SAVES.sha256`). The tests are `tests/test_orders.py` `split_army_197_armies` and `split_army_198_armies_cap`, and both passed twice.

## Corrections to earlier bot-side notes

These correct ic2-conquest's 2026-10-08 evening handover, not any report on this side.

1. The handover said "the game clamps Rome's armies to 188 on load". It does not. That save held 200 armies (12 AI + 188 Rome), and the memory table has room for exactly 198 records (0x47C1EC + 656 × 198). Reading the first 198 records gave 12 AI + 186 Rome = 198, and the earlier count of 188 came from that reading, not from a clamp. A save with more than 198 armies overflows the table and is not a valid pre-state.
2. The handover said "no `controls("Split army")`; the gate fires before the dialog or the click misses". The gate did fire. `Game.open_dialog` also reported the dialog as open, because **Wine's tooltip window for a toolbar button has the button's caption as its window name**. A title match alone is therefore not proof that a dialog opened. The new tests require a window wider than 200 px. Other `open_dialog` calls on toolbar buttons have the same latent false positive, which has not been fixed yet.

## Method

- Pre-state: `_make_patched_save_with_n_armies(BASE, n_rome_target = total − 12)` appends Rome dummy records at (305,130), each with one 3,200-man heavy infantry unit. BASE.SAV (270 BC Spring week 1, Rome human) has 14 armies: 2 Rome and 12 others.
- Fast rollingsave seed exe, seed 12345, Xvfb :99. Load, check `i16(0x4A0324) == total`, select army 0 at (100,37), which has 6 units (the selection is checked through `SEL_ARMY`, so a missed click is ruled out), click Split army on the army toolbar (x 415, y 108) at most twice, then read the count and the windows.

## Not established

- The other callers of `FUN_00449f08` (Mobilize R49, recruitment, AI splits) at 198.
- What a Cancel in the Split army dialog does with the record already taken at 197 (is it freed?).
