# Dialogs reached from other dialogs — verification of rows D01–D11

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`d5ccf24` (one of the `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/` batch
alongside H01–H05, MM01–MM10, K01–K03, M01–M06). Release
`run-exp-feature-inventory`, asset `FI_batch1_screenshots.tar.gz`; the
`tests/test_orders.py` fixtures (`T_*.SAV`, `NB_post_battle.SAV`) carry the
`[confirmed]` evidence.

**Closes** the cell-level verification of D01–D11 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
Eleven dialogs, all form-bound, sharing three extraction sources (`forms.json`,
`function_list.tsv`, `form_xrefs.tsv`) plus a fourth — the dialog's own
literals in `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` — for the boxes that print text.
One consolidated document.

**Tag policy:** carried from the inventory. `[confirmed]` rows have tracked
test/screenshot evidence; `[derived]` is code-cited only.

## Three open notes

1. **D10 (THVHBatPols) is `[derived]`** in the inventory. The form exists, the
   function-table row is exact, the literals (`" has defeated "`, `" will pay
   reparations of "`) match the inventory's prose, but **no test save**
   exercises the path — the precondition is two humans in one battle, which
   the harness doesn't currently drive. The reproduction would need a
   `tests/test_orders.py` extension that runs a 2-player game and reaches a
   battle where both sides are human seats. **Recorded as the one unclosed
   cell** in the D-section.
2. **D08 (TToEndTurn) warning-line literals are not in `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv`.**
   The five warnings — *"An army of yours needs supplies."*, *"An army of yours
   cannot afford to pay its mercenary units."*, *"A fleet of yours needs
   repairing."*, *"One of your fleets is not docked at its own city."*, *"A
   fleet of yours needs supplies."* — appear in
   [`2026-10-03-end-turn-warning-box.md`](2026-10-03-end-turn-warning-box.md) and
   the inventory's D08 row, but I did not see them in the literals table (only
   the prompt-side call sites are addressed). They are likely in a function the
   inventory doesn't name; the order matters for byte-exact reproduction but
   the **preconditions** (when each line shows) are already verified in the
   cited finding.
3. **D01 (TAFSupply) is opened from `TUnitMap_SupplyArmy` and from
   `TUnitMap_SupplyFleet` — but `TUnitMap_SupplyFleet` is listed twice in
   `form_xrefs.tsv`** (rows `0x00447854` and `0x004478af`). That's two call
   sites in the same function (probably the "buy at city" and "buy at foreign
   fleet" branches). Not a duplicate; both are real call sites. Recording so
   a clone reproduction cites both addresses if it traces the path.

## Inferences

- **D03 and D04 reuse one form for two dialogs.** `TArmyToArmy_InitializeForm`
  is called from `TUnitMap_ArmyToArmyTransfer` and from `TUnitMap_SplitArmy`;
  the second caller passes a different title (`"Split army"`). The same is
  true of `TFleetToFleet_InitializeForm` (Transfer ships vs Split fleet). A
  clone reproducing the section needs one form class per pair and a string
  parameter for the title — a single init that takes the title is the natural
  shape.
- **D07's four methods share one form.** `TChangeArmyUnits_RenameUnit` /
  `_SplitUnit` / `_JoinUnits` / `_Disband` are siblings in the same class; the
  form has four entry points. A clone reproduction groups them under one
  `ChangeUnits` class.
- **D09 and D10 share `TBattleOver_OK` as their entry.** Both
  `TBattlePols_InitializeForm` and `THVHBatPols_InitializeForm` are reached
  from the Battle-ended box's OK handler; the dispatch is decided inside
  `TBattleOver` (human-vs-AI → TBattlePols, human-vs-human → THVHBatPols).
  Carrying this through to clone code: one `BattleOver_OK` returns to
  `TBattlePols_InitializeForm` or `THVHBatPols_InitializeForm` based on whether
  both seats are human.

## What this does not establish

- D10's end-to-end save-diff (no `T_*.SAV` for the 2-human peace path;
  inventory `[derived]`).
- D08's per-warning-string byte-exact text (the joined strings are addressed
  by the inventory but not pinned down to literals in
  `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv`).
- D06's exact new-unit name template across all 20 slots — the literals show
  the suffix/suffix-piece pattern but not the slot-ordinal mapping.
- Whether any of the eleven dialogs are resizable / have a non-default caption
  (coverable from `form_controls.tsv` reads; not measured cell-by-cell here).

## Reproduction

```bash
cd ~/projects/ic2-conquest
python3 runs/experiments/feature_inventory/extract_forms.py        # regenerate form_controls.tsv + form_xrefs.tsv
python3 runs/experiments/feature_inventory/extract_dump_strings.py  # regenerate function_list.tsv + dump_string_literals.tsv

grep -E "TToEndTurn|TBattlePols|THVHBatPols|TBattleOver|TRenameArmyUnit|TSplitArmyUnit|TChangeArmyUnits|TArmyToArmy|TFleetToFleet|TAFSupply|TRecruitMercs" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/function_list.tsv
grep -E "TAFSupply|TArmyToArmy|TFleetToFleet|TRecruitMercs|TRenameArmyUnit|TChangeArmyUnits" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/form_xrefs.tsv
grep -nE "TBattlePols_InitializeForm|THVHBatPols_InitializeForm|TSplitArmyUnit_OK|TChangeArmyUnits_(RenameUnit|SplitUnit|JoinUnits|Disband)|TRenameArmyUnit|TRecruitMercs_RecruitMercUnit" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/dump_string_literals.v2.tsv

# Test-side regeneration (drives the dialogs):
pytest -k orders                                                          # the suite driven end-to-end
pytest tests/test_battle_b16.py -k accept_a_post_battle_peace             # D09 path
```

The form + function extracts are deterministic — they read the EXE and the
dump. The test runs are the only live-Wine step; the rest is offline.
