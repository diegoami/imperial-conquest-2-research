# Two fleets sailing toward each other: moves, supplies and condition per turn against the research formulas

**Status:** promoted from the `ic2-conquest` draft of the same name (branch `experiment/fleets-at-sea`, commit `edf6d34`). **Wine-only: every result below is a candidate until the desktop original confirms it.** It is task T1 of `docs/proposals/fleet-battles-and-storms.md`, run on the two-human setup of [2026-10-02-two-human-seats.md](2026-10-02-two-human-seats.md) (Carthage and Ptolemaic human, seed 12345). It is a **staging run**, not an experiment on storms or battles; the numbers are a by-product, **three rounds of two fleets** (8 turn-start readings), and they agree with the code reports they are compared with except for one unexplained first turn.

**Answer.**
- **A staging fixture:** the fleets of Carthage (90 ships) and Ptolemaic (70 ships) started 140 tiles apart, sailed toward each other along a computed sea path (139 tiles in six legs) and were **adjacent at the start of Ptolemaic's turn at 0723**, at war (relation 3): `saves/fleets-adjacent-at-sea-0723.SAV`. It took three rounds, 25 + 25, 28 + 23 and 25 + 13 tiles.
- **Moves per turn follow `30 − (ships − 50)/10`, minus 3 at zero supplies and `(70 − condition) >> 2` below condition 70, in 6 of 6 readings after the first turn** (Carthage 23, 23, 23; Ptolemaic 28, 25, 24). On the first turn both fleets had **25**, where the formula gives 26 and 28: unexplained.
- **Supplies burn `ships` tons a turn:** Carthage (90 ships) 80 → 0, Ptolemaic (70 ships) 80 → 10 → 0.
- **Condition fell 3 to 5 points a turn** on calm sea away from any own city, as the storm formula predicts (damage `2·dmg + 1`, plus up to 1 more at zero supplies): Carthage 85 → 81 → 78 → 74, Ptolemaic 75 → 72 → 67 → 63.

## Method

- **Build and seed:** `Imperial Conquest 2 fast rollingsave seed.exe` (SHA-256 `354d8265…532f`), Wine 9.0, Xvfb, `SEED.TXT` = 12345. Script `tests/make_fleet_battle_fixture.py`; the path planner `planner/sea.py` (calm sea cost 1, rough 3; `tests/test_sea_path.py`); driver `harness/driver.py`.
- **Procedure:** New Game with rows 1 and 3 human. Each seat's turn: copy the autosave at once (the second human's overwrites the first's), read the state, sail its fleet along the cheapest sea path to a tile next to the other fleet as far as its moves go (one tile per click, `Game.move_fleet`), End turn. Carthage set war toward Ptolemaic in its first turn (`Game.relation`). The run stops when the fleets are adjacent at the start of a seat's turn.
- **Readings:** from each seat-start autosave (`state/sav.py`): position, ships, condition, moves, supplies, money, per fleet. The turn-start readings are the four seat-2 saves (Ptolemaic's turn starts, 0720-0723) × the two fleets: at a seat-2 start both fleets have their full moves, while at a seat-13 start Ptolemaic's are already spent.

## Observations

Saves are in the release [`run-exp-fleet-battles`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-fleet-battles); the fixture is [`fleets-adjacent-at-sea-0723.SAV`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/blob/edf6d34/saves/fleets-adjacent-at-sea-0723.SAV) in `ic2-conquest` (both indexed in [`evidence-index.md`](../evidence-index.md)).

| turn | fleet | position | ships | condition | moves | supplies (t) | money | formula moves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 720 | Ptolemaic | (189,89) | 70 | 75 | **25** | 80 | 200 | 28 |
| 720 | Carthage | (49,62) | 90 | 85 | **25** | 80 | 1000 | 26 |
| 721 | Ptolemaic | (164,66) | 70 | 72 | 28 | 10 | 200 | 28 |
| 721 | Carthage | (74,52) | 90 | 81 | 23 | 0 | 1000 | 26 − 3 = 23 |
| 722 | Ptolemaic | (136,65) | 70 | 67 | 25 | 0 | 200 | 28 − 3 − 0 = 25 |
| 722 | Carthage | (97,64) | 90 | 78 | 23 | 0 | 1000 | 26 − 3 = 23 |
| 723 | Ptolemaic | (111,73) | 70 | 63 | 24 | 0 | 200 | 28 − 3 − 1 = 24 |
| 723 | Carthage | (110,73) | 90 | 74 | 23 | 0 | 1000 | 26 − 3 = 23 |

(All eight rows are from the saves `T1_0720_s02_Ptolemaic.SAV` … `T1_0723_s02_Ptolemaic.SAV`, the turn start of Ptolemaic's seat.) After sailing, `moves_after` was 0 except Carthage's last leg (10 left: it stopped adjacent), so the formula column is compared with the turn-start value only.

**Route.** In the Rome-seat start the planner's path from Carthage's fleet (49,62) to a tile next to Ptolemaic's (190,93) is 140 tiles, cost 140, all calm sea (`tests/test_sea_path.py`, which pins the planner on that committed save). The staging started from the two-human start, where Ptolemaic's fleet is at (189,89) (distance 140 to Carthage's, so 139 tiles to close to adjacent): the six legs below moved 25 + 25 + 28 + 23 + 25 + 13 = **139** tiles. Positions per seat: Ptolemaic (189,89) → (164,66) → (136,65) → (111,73); Carthage (49,62) → (74,52) → (97,64) → (110,73). The game accepted every one-tile click along the path and stopped nowhere early.

**Supplies.** 80 tons each at the start, `ships` tons burnt a turn: Carthage 80 − 90 → 0 (at 0 from turn 721), Ptolemaic 80 − 70 = 10 (turn 721), then 0 (722).
**Condition.** Carthage 85, 81, 78, 74 (−4, −3, −4); Ptolemaic 75, 72, 67, 63 (−3, −5, −4). For condition 85 the storm formula's `max(1, Random(100 − condition)/10)` is 1, so damage `2·1 + 1 = 3` away from a city, plus `Random(2)` at zero supplies (the −4 turns); for condition 75 it is 1 or 2, so 3 or 5. The observed drops are all among those values.
**Money aboard:** Carthage's fleet 1,000 talents, Ptolemaic's 200, both unchanged.
**The first turn.** Both fleets showed **25** moves at 0720 (seat 2 and 13 starts) although their supplies were 80 tons (no penalty) and their condition ≥ 70: the formula gives 26 (90 ships) and 28 (70 ships). `docs/rules-digest.md` §10 notes moves 8 in the start state becoming 9 after the first tick for armies ("the session-start effect"); a similar start-of-game effect for fleets is a guess, not tested.

**War.** Carthage's war order in its first turn: the relation Carthage–Ptolemaic is 3 in every later save (`T1_0721_s02_Ptolemaic.SAV` onward), as in the T0 finding.

## Inferences

- The fleet formulas in the research reports hold on every reading after the first turn, including the zero-supply and low-condition terms, and the supply burn and the condition drift fit the storm and supply formulas; this is a confirmation of the code reports, small (8 readings, one seed, calm sea, no rough water, no army aboard).
- Fleets of 90 and 70 ships close 140 tiles in about three rounds when both sail (≈ 25 each a turn), with the second mover able to stop adjacent: the staging works without surprises from the AI, the weather or the other human.
- The two fleets arrive with **condition 74 and 63 and zero supplies**: any battle from this fixture is between worn, unsupplied fleets. For the plan's equal-condition cells, supply and repair must be part of the staging; for the "condition term" cells, the natural difference (74 v 63) is a free pair.

## What this does not establish

- **Any battle:** this is staging; the fleets were not attacked or attacking. **Storms, rough water and loss at sea:** not tested; every tile of the route was calm and the damage observed is the ordinary kind.
- **The first-turn deviation** (25 against 26 and 28): unexplained, two readings.
- **The condition formula's randomness:** three drops per fleet cannot show a distribution; "consistent with" is all that is claimed.
- **Other seeds, other nations, an army aboard** (the formula's cargo term): not tested. **Wine-only.**

## Review notes (research repository, 2026-10-02)

- **Saves retrieved and re-read** (the seven `T1_*.SAV` of the release and the fixture, with the bot's parser). Every position, ship count, condition, moves, supplies and money in the Observations table matches; the Carthage–Ptolemaic relation is 3 from `T1_0721` on; the fixture is the `T1_0723_s02_Ptolemaic.SAV` state (Ptolemaic at (111,73), Carthage at (110,73), adjacent). The sea path, the click log and the formula column are not in the saves and were not re-checked.
- **The formulas compared against are the ones in [supply-driven-morale-and-fleet-attrition.md](supply-driven-morale-and-fleet-attrition.md), read from code:** `supplies −= ships` every turn, moves `30 − (ships − 50)/10`, `−3` at zero supplies, `−(70 − condition) >> 2` below 70, and the storm damage `2·dmg + 1`. The draft applies them correctly, and the six readings after the first turn are the live confirmation of a code reading whose only data so far were the Carthaginian series and the Ptolemaic control in that report. No contradiction.
- **The unexplained first turn probably is not a deviation.** The 0720 readings are taken before any weekly tick has run (the calendar is still week 1), and the moves in them are the New Game's initial values, not the output of the formula. Supporting data in the saves already cited: Carthage's 90-ship fleet reads 25 moves in the Rome start (`run0-start-AUTO0720-seed12345.SAV`) and in the Ptolemaic-seat start alike, and Ptolemaic's 70-ship fleet reads 25 in its own start but **21** in the Rome start, where its fleet stands four tiles away at (190,93) at condition 100: the AI seat spent 4 of its 25 moves in between. Two different ship counts with the same 25 point to one fixed initial value. This is an inference from three saves, **not read from the code**; the New Game fill that sets fleet moves has not been looked at (compare [decompiled-new-game-mercenary-fill.md](decompiled-new-game-mercenary-fill.md) for the other New Game fills).
- **Storm check.** The condition drops (Carthage −4, −3, −4; Ptolemaic −3, −5, −4) are all values the storm formula and the zero-supply term allow. Three drops per fleet cannot test the distribution, as the draft says.
- **Route length.** The draft was corrected after promotion: the planner's 140-tile path is from the Rome-seat start; the staging run started two-human, where the fleets were 140 tiles apart and the six legs closed 139 (25 + 25 + 28 + 23 + 25 + 13). Carried into the text above.
- **Not re-run.** No code address was re-read from the executable, and the formulas were not re-derived.
