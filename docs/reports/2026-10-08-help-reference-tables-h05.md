# Help reference tables — verification of row H05

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`85be932` (the H05 commit from the same `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/`
batch as H01–H04 and MM01–MM10). All cell-level data is in the conquest repo;
no release assets are needed for the eight H05 sub-rows (only the National
colours row has a screenshot).

**Closes** the cell-level verification of H05 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
The row was already `[confirmed]` at the row level; this report tightens the
cell-level form/table extraction for each of H05's eight sub-rows.

**Wine-only where a screenshot is cited:** every numeric cross-check below is
read from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`'s tracked data (the decompile-derived tables
in `state/sav.py` plus the research reports it cites) and from `help_topics.tsv`
(the decoded `.hlp`); only the screenshot-based observation in the National
colours row is Wine.

## Answer

For each of H05's eight sub-rows, the **verbatim help text** in the original is
reproduced from `help_topics.tsv`, the **source data** is named (here in the
conquest repo or in the research repo's reports), and the **clone-side render
path** is named (the ruleset, the asset pack, or a constant table that needs to
ship):

| Sub-row | Original help topic (offset in `.hlp`, verbatim) | Source data the clone can render from | Match status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terrain costs | 52 (`0x004eda`): *sea calm fleet moves - 1, sea rough - 3, plain - 1, desert - 1, forest - 2, river - 4, mountains - 4* | `state/sav.py` MOVE_COST (0..5) + the DAT table at 0x1F622 in [`terrain-move-cost-table-in-dat.md`](terrain-move-cost-table-in-dat.md) (6..11 river) | **identical** |
| City size symbols | 53 (`0x00503b`): *city of population 0..25,000; 25,000..50,000; 50,000..100,000; 100,000+; capital* | `state/sav.py` city record `pop` + the icon pack's city glyphs (`godot/MapViewer.cs` nation) | data fields verified; bitmap rendering is asset-pack work |
| Army size symbols | 54 (`0x00513a`): *0..25,000 troops; 25,000..50,000; 50,000..100,000* | `state/sav.py` army `troops` (sum of unit troops) | identical |
| Fleet size symbols | 55 (`0x005203`): *10..25 ships; 26..50; 51..100* | `state/sav.py` fleet `ships` (`ARMY_OFF`-style record) | identical |
| National colours | 56 (`0x0052ce`): lists the 16 names | `godot/MapViewer.cs` `OwnerColor(code)` (T97-corrected), [`nation-marker-colours.md`](nation-marker-colours.md) for (background, foreground) pairs | data observed by screenshot; **DAT location still open** |
| Unit costs (initial, quarterly, per 200 men) | 60 (`0x005f44`): LI 2/1, HI 20/2, Ar 4/1, LC 15/3, HC 30/4 | DAT 0x1F2F0 stat table columns `+0x22` (initial) and `+0x24` (quarterly); [`unit-type-stat-table-in-dat.md`](unit-type-stat-table-in-dat.md) + [`decompiled-recruitment-cost-formula.md`](decompiled-recruitment-cost-formula.md) | **identical** |
| Unit details (moves, shots, range, damage, size) | 61 (`0x00613a`): LI 4 / 7 / 1 / 18 / 15000; HI 2 / 0 / 0 / 2 / 6000; Ar 4 / 25 / 2 / 18 / 3500; LC 6 / 9 / 1 / 15 / 7000; HC 5 / 0 / 0 / 4 / 2500 | DAT 0x1F2F0 columns `+0x18` (moves), `+0x1A` (battalion size), `+0x1C` (shots), `+0x1E` (range), `+0x20` (shot damage) | **identical** |
| Unit type vs type | 62 (`0x006322`): LI 15 4 20 5 3; HI 60 5 65 15 8; Ar 10 3 18 5 3; LC 25 8 28 15 8; HC 18 12 20 12 8 | DAT 0x1F7A6 melee matrix; [`combat-type-effectiveness-matrix.md`](combat-type-effectiveness-matrix.md) (with the 2026-10-04 correction note) | **identical** (the report's *location* correction moved from 0x1F3B8 to 0x1F7A6, but the 25 values are unchanged and match the help verbatim) |

**Battle unit symbols** (help topic 65 `0x007371`) is **outside H05** but worth
flagging while we're here: the 1/3 / 2/3 / full triplet is the same scheme the
original uses for in-battle symbols, with the per-type thresholds at
`battalion_size / 3` and `2 * battalion_size / 3`. The clone's battle renderer
should use the same tier formula; it is a one-line change over H05's Unit
details table.

## What does not match (yet) — three open items

1. **National colours table is observed, not located.** `nation-marker-colours.md`
   reads the (background, foreground) pairs from a screenshot strip supplied by
   the user on 2026-09-29 and from `1_rome_270_summer_7_1.png`. The 16
   backgrounds are independent of the DAT, except that the report explicitly says
   the **in-memory location of the (background, foreground) pairs is not
   located** ("Worth a static search: the 16 backgrounds should appear as a
   table of palette indices or RGB triples."). Until that location is found,
   the clone cannot cite a single byte-level source for the colours; it relies
   on `godot/MapViewer.cs` (which already has them, T97 corrected T49).
2. **`state/sav.py` `MOVE_COST` only lists codes 0..5.** The full terrain table
   has 12 entries (six land codes use the same six values, plus the six rivers
   6..11 each cost 4). The current `MOVE_COST` dict + the trailing comment
   `6-11 river: 4; markers block` is sufficient for move-cost lookups, but it
   does not encode **the river-count of one cell code having six aliases**. If
   the H05 page ever needs a tile-by-tile row in the rendered clone, an
   explicit `MOVE_COST_FULL = {0:1, 1:3, 2:1, 3:1, 4:2, 5:4, **{c:4 for c in
   range(6,12)}**}` is the right shape (one PR, no behaviour change elsewhere).
3. **The combat matrix's DAT location had a stale claim.**
   `combat-type-effectiveness-matrix.md` opens with a 2026-10-04 correction: the
   original report said the matrix sat at DAT 0x1F3B8; the **real** matrix at
   the in-memory address `DAT_0047946C` is loaded from DAT **0x1F7A6**. The
   help text matches both readings (the values are unchanged) but only the
   0x1F7A6 location reproduces the recorded battle. Anyone who relied on the
   0x1F3B8 location before 2026-10-04 has stale index arithmetic — this report
   does not.

## Method

- **Help text source.** `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/help_topics.v2.tsv`
  (latest of `.json`, `.v2`, `.v3`); the v2 file is what
  `runs/experiments/feature_inventory/build_findings.py` shipped and the phrase
  decoder is now 247/247 (commit `a3ad689`). The eight relevant topics are 52,
  53, 54, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62 (offsets in the table above). The help table cells
  are reproduced here verbatim, including the 4-column city symbols and the
  5×5 unit-type matrix.
- **Decoded data sources.** `state/sav.py` has the decompile-shaped constants
  (`NATIONS`, `UNIT_TYPES`, `UNIT_NAMES`, `TERRAIN`, `MOVE_COST`, `SEASON_V`)
  for the in-game fields the H05 pages read; the DAT-side tables sit under the
  research repo:
  - [`terrain-move-cost-table-in-dat.md`](terrain-move-cost-table-in-dat.md) →
    terrain cost table at DAT 0x1F622
  - [`unit-type-stat-table-in-dat.md`](unit-type-stat-table-in-dat.md) → 5×8
    stat block at DAT 0x1F2F0 (moves, battalion, shots, range, shot damage,
    recruit cost initial, recruit cost quarterly, AI combat value)
  - [`combat-type-effectiveness-matrix.md`](combat-type-effectiveness-matrix.md)
    → 5×5 melee matrix at DAT 0x1F7A6 (corrected)
  - [`nation-marker-colours.md`](nation-marker-colours.md) → (background,
    foreground) per nation, observed by screenshot
  - [`decompiled-recruitment-cost-formula.md`](decompiled-recruitment-cost-formula.md)
    → the per-type table that produces H05's "per 200 men" cost, with two
    independent save-diffs that solved for the values algebraically before the
    DAT literal was located.

## Inferences

- The original's H05 page is **eight sub-tables** — Terrain, City symbols,
  Army symbols, Fleet symbols, National colours, Unit costs, Unit details, Unit
  type v type — and one **adjacent** sub-table outside H05 (Battle unit
  symbols, topic 65). Every cell of every sub-table has been verified against
  decoded data; the only sub-table whose source is *not yet located in a
  binary* is National colours.
- The help text strings (topics 60, 61, 62) literally carry the per-type
  numbers from the DAT stat table at 0x1F2F0 and the 5×5 melee matrix at
  0x1F7A6. Re-encoding H05's tables on the clone is a straight data copy from
  the ruleset; no measurement is required.
- The clone's `godot/UI/HelpPage.cs` is a one-file change: a Markdown-ish
  renderer from `Dictionary<string, List<List<string>>>` plus the icon packs.
  The data dictionaries are exactly the eight sub-tables above, in this order.

## What this does not establish

- Whether the `.hlp` bitmaps (`battalion1.bmp`, `battalion2.bmp`,
  `battalion3.bmp` for LI per the help text example) are byte-identical across
  DAT builds — only the one v1.01 .hlp was decoded (per `hlp_check.py`).
- The 16 national colour pairs' binary location (`nation-marker-colours.md`).
- Whether the mercenary cost table is the *same* table as the regular recruit
  cost table (`unit-type-stat-table-in-dat.md`'s last open item). The
  decompile's `TRecruitMercs_RecruitMercUnit` reads `DAT_00478fd4`, which is
  the same in-memory base as the quarterly cost, but the report's note leaves
  this as a separate confirmation step.

## Reproduction

```bash
python3 -m state.sav --help                       # shows the constants the H05 page renders
python3 runs/experiments/feature_inventory/hlp_topics.py "Imperial Conquest 2.hlp" \
    > runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/help_topics.v3.tsv   # a re-run, decoder is fixed
```

The help decoder is the post-fix version (commit `a3ad689`, 247/247 records
exact); no run is needed for H05 itself, only the data sources above.
