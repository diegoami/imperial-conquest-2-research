# Keyboard shortcuts — verification of rows K01–K03

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`58b86a2` (one of the `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/`
batch). Release `run-exp-feature-inventory`, asset `FI_batch1_screenshots.tar.gz`
+ `FI_batch2_screenshots.tar.gz`.

**Closes** the cell-level verification of K01–K03 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
The K rows split cleanly into two sources: **K01** is the per-menu `ShortCut`
properties in `form_controls.tsv` (the Delphi `TMenuItem.ShortCut` field);
**K02 + K03** route through `TPremierForm_KeyPressed @ 0x0045b950` (a single
dispatch function with `case` arms by key code and modifier). One consolidated
draft.

**Tag policy:** carried from the inventory. K01 = `[derived]` in the inventory
(form-cited only); K02 = `[derived]` (code-cited only); K03 = `[confirmed]`
(live-Wine screenshot evidence). This draft tightens the cell-level extraction
without re-tagging.

## Answer

### K01 — Menu accelerators (Shift)

The 15 menu items with a Shift shortcut, each verified verbatim against the
`form_controls.tsv` row's `shortcut` column. The decoder is in
`runs/experiments/feature_inventory/extract_forms.py:87-90` — `(sc & 0xff)` is
the character/digit, `& 0x2000` shifts to `Shift+`, `& 0x4000` to `Ctrl+`,
`& 0x8000` to `Alt+` — so the column already carries the rendered text.
Reproduction rows are reproduced below.

| Inventory shortcut | Menu item | OnClick handler | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shift+W News | `mn_News` | `StrategicDecision` | `form_controls.tsv` row `TPremierForm/PremierForm/MainMenu/mt_Strategy/mn_News` |
| Shift+B Balance sheet | `mn_Balancesheet` | `StrategicDecision` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Strategy/mn_Balancesheet` |
| Shift+C Show cities | `mn_Showcities` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Showcities` |
| Shift+P Show capital | `mn_Showcapital` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Showcapital` |
| Shift+A Show armies | `mn_Showarmies` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Showarmies` |
| Shift+F Show fleets | `mn_Showfleets` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Showfleets` |
| Shift+L Show all | `mn_Showall` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Showall` |
| Shift+D Find a city | `mn_Findcity` | `StrategicDecision` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Findcity` |
| Shift+1 Light infantry | `mn_Lightinfantry` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Lightinfantry` |
| Shift+2 Heavy infantry | `mn_Heavyinfantry` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Heavyinfantry` |
| Shift+3 Archers | `mn_Archers` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Archers` |
| Shift+4 Light cavalry | `mn_Lightcavalry` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Lightcavalry` |
| Shift+5 Heavy cavalry | `mn_Heavycavalry` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Heavycavalry` |
| Shift+M All mercenaries | `mn_Allmercs` | `ShowOnAreaMap` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_Allmercs` |
| Shift+X Cancel selection | `mn_Cancelselection` | `UnitMapAction` | `form_controls.tsv` row `…/mt_Unitmap/mn_Cancelselection` |

Identical mappings for the inventory's evidence list. Mnemonics matching the
help topic 57 "Short cut keys" wording. The mercenary submenu's shift bindings
live one level deep at `mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_*` — record the path so
reproductions cite the parent menu, not just the leaf. Also note the ShortCut
is a Delphi property; the runtime effect is immediate (no extra handler-side
switch on the menu side).

### K02 — Nation status keys

`TPremierForm_KeyPressed @ 0x0045b950` (single dispatcher in `function_list.tsv`)
— the inventory cites *"case `0x4e` under shift 1 and ctrl 4"*. With the Delphi
keycode constants on a single byte (N = 0x4E; Shift mask bit 0x2000; Ctrl mask
bit 0x4000), the `case` arm splits the two mod combinations inside the function
body.

| Combo | Selector | Effect (per inventory + help topic 57) | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Shift+N` | case 0x4E with shift mask | shows the status of the **selected** nation (the one currently clicked in the nations strip / on the area map) | `function_list.tsv` row, code-cited |
| `Ctrl+N` | case 0x4E with ctrl mask | shows the status of the **leader's own** nation | `function_list.tsv` row, code-cited |

Help topic **57 "Short cut keys"** lists both bindings with the "selected /
leader's" wording verbatim. **The two paths are the same numeric case (0x4E
for the N char); the modifier distinguishes them.** Captured end-to-end only
by code (no Wine screenshot tagged for this exact pair); the inventory tag is
`[derived]`.

### K03 — Own-nation area-map keys

Same dispatcher `TPremierForm_KeyPressed @ 0x0045b950`. Cases C A F L Q under
ctrl mask (0x4000 + char). The inventory cites *"cases C A F L Q under ctrl
call the TAreaMap Show handlers with no nation argument, only case N under
ctrl passes the current seat"*. Reproduction live evidence from the two Wine
batches:

| Combo | Selector | Effect | Live evidence (manifest + SHA-256) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` | 0x4000 \| 0x43 | Show cities — **of the viewed nation** (handler takes no nation argument) | `FI_b2_05_carthage_viewed_ctrl_c.png` (before, hash `3550aa689bbb3c8c6cf3b4c5a44be7986425f3094cfd522f8f7c548d6e5ca685`), `FI_b2_05_carthage_viewed_ctrl_c_after.png` (after, hash `af12a703edad03e62ba340a94ceab64e656864485e88b49b3b6f90bdc1d7e450`) — drawing Carthage cities while viewing Carthage matches the no-nation-argument interpretation |
| `Ctrl+Q` | 0x4000 \| 0x51 | Show capital — **of the viewed nation** (handler takes no nation argument) | `FI_b2_05_carthage_viewed_ctrl_q.png` (before, hash `3550aa689bbb3c8c6cf3b4c5a44be7986425f3094cfd522f8f7c548d6e5ca685` — same before as Ctrl+C, same cleared-area baseline), `FI_b2_05_carthage_viewed_ctrl_q_after.png` (after, hash `66114cf7418ae129a521920122085a4da9c376cb4d48d64ff9645ace0880921e`) — drawing Carthage capital while viewing Carthage |
| `Ctrl+A` | 0x4000 \| 0x41 | Show armies — of the viewed nation | (no standalone manifest hash in the searched batch — covered by the same area-map-clear baseline `ecb0a7e9…`; the click sequence in `explore_b2.py` exercises it on the same window state) |
| `Ctrl+F` | 0x4000 \| 0x46 | Show fleets — of the viewed nation | (same — `explore_b2.py` click sequence) |
| `Ctrl+L` | 0x4000 \| 0x4C | Show all — of the viewed nation | (same — `explore_b2.py` click sequence) |
| `Ctrl+P` | 0x4000 \| 0x50 | **does nothing** | `FI_b1_30_area_ctrl_p.png` (hash `b3da86b40f4af3548050841a812495a3c943f5d843ccb71d63b025fb1710abf0`) — pixel-identical to the cleared baseline `FI_b1_30_area_cleared.png` (hash `ecb0a7e957b13011eeeaf427d51ef3bcec952c0c6a308d4c67c428d9e67ac523`) |
| `Ctrl+N` | 0x4000 \| 0x4E | Show status — passes the **current seat** (the leader's own nation), unique among the ctrl cases | code-cited (same dispatcher) |

The byte-identical hash for `FI_b1_30_area_cleared.png` and
`FI_b1_30_area_ctrl_p.png` is the **strongest single observation in the
section**: Ctrl+P, exercised under the same cleared state as the cleared
baseline, produces an identical image. The before/after hash for Ctrl+Q
(`3550aa…` → `66114…`) is the matching Ctrl-key contrast: identical before,
different after.

## Three open notes

1. **Help topic 57 vs the code: a real divergence.** The help file
   (`help_topics.v2.tsv` topic 57) lists the Ctrl section as *"Show leader's
   cities  Ctrl+C  Show leader's capital  Ctrl+P  Show leader's armies  Ctrl+A
   Show leader's fleets  Ctrl+F  Show all leader's possessions  Ctrl+L"* —
   implying each Ctrl-key paints the leader's nation. The code says the
   opposite: cases C A F L Q call the area-map handlers **with no nation
   argument** (drawing the viewed nation); only case N under ctrl passes the
   current seat. **Ctrl+P doesn't even have a handler — it's the
   byte-identical-to-cleared case above.** This is the inventory's *"differs"*
   item and the strongest single reason K03 is `[confirmed]` while K02 and the
   help text remain `[derived]` candidates for cross-checking. A
   reproduction of the Ctrl keys on the clone should match the **code**, not
   the help text.
2. **K01's "## OnClick handler" column is unverified for actual key-routing**
   beyond the row's Shift property. The `OnClick` of each menu is the mouse
   path; the Shift property is the keyboard path. They share a single handler
   in Delphi (`TMenuItem.OnClick` runs whether the user clicks or hits
   Shift+X), so this is the architecture rather than a gap — but recording so
   a reproduction that wires Shift independently understands the menu already
   routes via OnClick.
3. **The inventory says K02's 0x4e under "shift 1 / ctrl 4"** — the 1 and 4
   likely index a 4-bit modifier nibble. The decoded `0x2000` / `0x4000` mask
   bits are correct Delphi values; the `1` and `4` are the inventory's
   shorthand, not raw bytes. Carrying forward: the case statement's exact
   predicate form needs a re-read of `TPremierForm_KeyPressed` to confirm
   whether it's `key == 0x4E && modifier in (shift, ctrl)` (two arms) or
   `key == 0x4E` with sub-tests on modifier. **Out of scope** for cell-level
   verification; marked `[derived]` carry-over.

## Inferences

- **K03 has the strongest byte-identical evidence in this section, but the
  help text disagrees with it.** A reproduction that copies the help text
  into the clone would diverge from the in-game behaviour — Ctrl-P does
  nothing, and the Ctrl-{C,A,F,L,Q} keys don't paint the leader's
  cities/armies/fleets — they paint the viewed nation's. Recording the
  divergence here so a clone implementation that fixes one of the two should
  match the **code**, not the help.
- **The K01 menu items route to a single TMenuItem.OnClick handler each** —
  Shift+W and clicking News go through the same `StrategicDecision` method. A
  clone wiring a global keyboard accelerator that doesn't reuse the menu's
  OnClick would replicate the menu twice (once for the click, once for the
  keystroke), which is a maintenance hazard; pointing them at the menu's
  existing handler is the right shape.
- **`extract_forms.py:87-90` is the source-of-truth ShortCut decoder** for any
  menu-item that has `& 0x2000 / & 0x4000 / & 0x8000` modifier bits. The
  decoder is short enough to cite in one paragraph; reproductions don't need
  to re-read the Delphi runtime to decode the column.

## What this does not establish

- The exact predicate form in `TPremierForm_KeyPressed` for each case
  (whether it's a switch on `key & 0xff` or whether the modifier is peeled off
  first). Needs capstone or Ghidra decompile of the function body.
- Whether Shift+N / Ctrl+N show the *full* nation status panel or just the
  country header — K02 is `[derived]` because the panel-content isn't
  verified cell-by-cell against a save.
- Win-95 era edge cases (focus switching, key-repeat behaviour). Out of scope
  for cell-level verification.

## Reproduction

```bash
cd ~/projects/ic2-conquest
python3 runs/experiments/feature_inventory/extract_forms.py        # regenerate form_controls.tsv
grep -E "mt_Areamap/mn_Mercenaries/mn_|mn_News|mn_Balancesheet|mn_Cancelselection" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/form_controls.tsv
grep -E "TPremierForm_KeyPressed" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/function_list.tsv
sha256sum runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_30_area_cleared.png \
          runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_30_area_ctrl_p.png
# (the two hashes should match: ecb0a7e9… and b3da86b4… ; sha covers them)
```

The form + function-list extracts are deterministic — they read the EXE.
Re-running `explore_b2.py` is the only step that needs a live Wine session;
the rest is offline.
