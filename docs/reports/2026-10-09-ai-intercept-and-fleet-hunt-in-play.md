# AI checks 3 and 4 in play: the homeland intercept and the fleet hunt-or-port decision fire as decompiled, logged by an inert hook over 144 End turns. The hunt score does not fall with distance, and a fleet called as a ferry skips the hunt

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit `4ede45f`. Release
[`run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt)
holds one asset, `run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt-saves.tar.gz`, with every autosave of the runs. The
SHA-256s of its 213 saves are committed at `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt/SAVES.sha256`.
Wine-only. The hook build is `patches/ai_hook.py` of the seed exe. It does checks 3 and 4, left open
by [`2026-10-07-ai-turn-corroboration.md`](2026-10-07-ai-turn-corroboration.md), and corrects §3.1,
§4 and §5 of [`2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md`](2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md).

**Review note:**
- **Saves:** I extracted the tarball, and all 213 saves hash OK. **Inertness:** all 65 hook/plain
  pairs listed in `SAVES.sha256` are byte-identical.
- **Decompile,** read in the tracked excerpts:
  - **`FUN_0044f4f8`:** the score starts at −10,000 (`0xd8f0`). Candidates are enemy fleets at war
    (relation 3), launched, and not docked (`FUN_004494e4` = −1). In the loop,
    `s = my×100/their − d`, doubled when `their < my` and `d < 0x12`. The best `s` is kept, and at
    0x44f5f4 the best `d` is added back. The caller at 0x44f682 hunts only on `> 0x64`.
  - **`FUN_0044aa54`:** `v = ships×condition/10 + FUN_0044a930(army)/50`, then
    `v + Random(4) × (v / 10)`.
  - **`FUN_0044efc8`:** at 0x44f255/0x44f257, a relation below 3 needs `[esp+6] >= 0x14`.
- **Hunts recomputed with my own code,** from the v3 decision-time records in `hook_s2.jsonl`:
  - **Corrected formula:** all 6 fit with one or more jitter pairs out of 16. One fit is the
    174-tile hunt, where 696×100/658 = 105 gives a score of 105 against an old-formula value of −69.
  - **Hunt 36** (Ptolemaic carrying army 7, 18,600 weighted troops) fits only with the
    decision-time morale of 68 (3 pairs). With the save's morale of 70 it fits none. That confirms
    both the army term and the morale point.
  - **Old formula:** fits none of the 6.
- **All four seeds' final runs,** swept for branch consistency: 341 port moves all ≤ 100; 7 hunts
  all > 100 and aimed at the hunted fleet's logged position; 102 intercepts all aimed at the
  threat's position; no fleet decision with a stored destination.
- **Derived from the scorer** (my reading, `[derived]`): a weaker target always has
  `my×100/their ≥ 100`, so the fleet hunts when its **best-ranked** target is weaker after jitter.
  The only exception is a ratio of exactly 100 at 18 or more tiles. Distance still matters for
  *which* target ranks first: a near stronger fleet can outrank a far weaker one and suppress the
  hunt.
- **Not re-checkable from tracked data:** the `FUN_0044d9a8.asm` excerpt ends at 0x44da22, after the
  fleet selection (nearest own fleet: empty, launched, with moves), and before any `+4` write. So
  "it sets the fleet's destination", and "only two places write `+4`", are ic2-conquest's reading,
  not re-checked here. The staged ferry link is `[derived]`, as the draft says.
- **Not re-run:** the intercept-side distance and radius checks (`analyze.py`), apart from the
  target-position sweep above.

**Tag:** `[confirmed]` (Wine, natural play with an inert hook) for checks 3 and 4; `[confirmed:
decompile]` for the four corrections; ferry: decompile (partly re-checkable) + `[derived]` link (L1
staged).

## How it was observed

- **The hook:** a build of the seed exe (`patches/ai_hook.py`) re-points the AI's decision calls to stubs. Each stub logs the decision and jumps on to the original target:
  - the two moves of `FUN_0044efc8`: toward the threat, or to the capital;
  - the two moves of `FUN_0044f608` after the hunt scorer: hunt, or port;
  - in v4, also its stored-destination move.

  Each record holds the nation, the unit, the target, the caller's locals (scores, distances, chosen indices) and the unit records **at decision time**. That matters because army and fleet indices shift within a turn, and AI moves in a save are left over from the unit's last turn.
  - The stubs preserve every register, flag and the stack (`tests/test_ai_hook.py`, unicorn, 5 sites × 4 buffer states × 20 random states).
  - **The hooked game is byte-identical to the plain one:** 25/25 autosaves (v1) and 25/25 (v2) at seed 12345, 40/40 (v2) and 40/40 (v3) at seed 2.
- **The games:** natural play from `saves/run0-start-AUTO0720-seed12345.SAV`, with Rome human and only End turn clicked. Seeds 12345 (25 End turns), 2 (40), 10 (40) and 14 (39), so **144 End turns**.
- **The counts: 457 decisions logged**: 102 intercepts toward an army, 7 intercepts to the capital, 341 port moves and 7 hunts. **All 457 pass every decision-time check** (`summary.json`).

## Check 3: the homeland intercept `[confirmed]`

**What the code does** (`FUN_0044efc8.asm`, `[confirmed: decompile]`):

1. **The threats:** up to 9 foreign armies (owner ≥ 0, not the nation) whose position is in the capital's region box (`FUN_0044eb9c` = 0). They must be within Chebyshev distance 20 of the capital when the threat's owner is at war with the nation (relation 3), else within 10.
2. **The responders:** own armies with moves > 0, while fewer than threats + 2 have been dispatched. An army is skipped when an army target or a city target scores above 100, its distance is below the army's moves, and the capital is more than 3 × moves away.
3. **The choice:** the nearest threat. **A threat whose owner is not at war is accepted only when the responder is at least 20 from the capital** (`cmp [esp+6], 0x14`). This rule is not in the report.
4. **The branch:**
   - toward the threat army (`FUN_0044dba8(army, threat xy)`) when the nation is at war with its owner and it is on land (cell ≠ −1);
   - otherwise back to the capital.

**In play** (`analysis_hook_s*.json`):
- **102 dispatches toward an enemy army** in all four seeds, by Galatia, Illyria, Greece, Macedonia, Seleucid and others. For every one:
  - the responder is the nation's own and has moves at decision time;
  - the game's own distances to the capital and to the threat equal Chebyshev distances recomputed from the logged positions;
  - the threat is within 20 of the capital and at war with the nation;
  - the exemption rule does not apply.
- **7 dispatches back to the capital,** all of the "not at war" kind and all Gaul's (seeds 12345 and 10): armies pulled home from 27 to 52 tiles away because a Carthaginian army (relation 2) stood 1 to 9 tiles from Gaul's capital. The ≥ 20 acceptance rule held in all 7.
- **No threat aboard a fleet occurred,** so that branch is not observed.
- **A war declared earlier in the same turn counts:** in 7 seed-14 records Greece and Macedonia go to war in the diplomacy phase (news "Greece declares war on Macedonia."), which runs before the army phase. Their armies are dispatched at each other in the same turn.
- **The armies then move:** 54 of the 102 armies ended the round closer to the threat's logged position, and 30 were gone or renumbered by the next save. The other 18 ended level or farther: the threat itself moves later in the round. Of the 7 sent home, 5 got closer to the capital.

## Check 4: the fleet hunt or port `[confirmed]`

**What the code does** (`FUN_0044f4f8_f608.asm`, `[confirmed: decompile]`). For each own fleet that is launched (countdown −1):

1. resupply (`FUN_0044e5dc`), then pick a port (`FUN_0044e9a8`);
2. **if the fleet has a stored destination (+4 ≥ 0), sail there, with no hunt and no port choice;**
3. otherwise, if moves > 0, score the hunt (`FUN_0044f4f8`): **above 100 (strictly), chase the target fleet's position; otherwise sail to the port.**

**In play:**
- **341 port moves,** all with a hunt score ≤ 100 (−10,000 when no enemy fleet qualifies) and a target equal to the chosen port city's position. Every fleet was launched, had moves and had no stored destination.
- **7 hunts** (seeds 2 and 14), all with a score above 100: Numidia chasing Ptolemaic (4 at seed 2, 1 at seed 14), Ptolemaic chasing Numidia, and Carthage chasing Ptolemaic.
  - All at war, and the target was the hunted fleet's position at decision time.
  - All 7 ended the round closer to it.
  - **They chased across 26 to 181 tiles.**

## Corrections to the report (research [`2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md`](2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md))

1. **The hunt score does not fall with distance (§4).**
   - In the loop the score is `my × 100 / their − d`, doubled when the target is weaker and `d < 18`. **On return the chosen target's distance is added back** (0x44f5f4: `add [score], best distance`).
   - So the score compared with 100 is `my × 100 / their` for a target at 18 or more, and `2 × (ratio − d) + d` for a weaker one closer than 18. Distance only ranks the candidates.
   - **In play, an AI fleet chases any weaker enemy fleet at war that is at sea, however far.** Numidia chased Ptolemaic from 174 tiles away (`AUTO0751.SAV`, seed 2).
   - The 6 hunts logged by v3 (seed 2) are reproduced **exactly** by this formula, with the decision-time ships and condition and one jitter pair each (`hunt_bounds_hook_s2.v7.json`, the last version). The report's formula reproduces none of the 6 (`hunt_bounds_hook_s2.json`, scored with the before-turn values that v2 recorded).
2. **Boundaries:**
   - the hunt needs a score **above** 100 (`jle 0x64`), not ≥ 100;
   - the doubling needs `d < 18` (`cmp bx, 0x12; jge`), not "within 18".
3. **The strength jitter is `v + Random(4) × (v div 10)`** (`FUN_0044aa54`), not `Random(4) × v / 10` (§5). The rounding matters for an exact fit.
   - The carried army adds `(Σ troops, ×3 for archers) div 80 × morale div 50`, with the morale **at decision time**.
   - In the turn-36 hunt, army 7's morale had already fallen from 70 to 68, because its supplies ran out that turn.
4. **The intercept accepts a non-war threat only for a responder at least 20 from the capital (§3.1).** All 7 capital dispatches were of this kind.

## A ferry call takes the fleet before the hunt `[confirmed]` + `[derived]`

- **The staged start (L1):** `saves/fleets-adjacent-at-sea-0723.SAV`, with Carthage made a computer seat (human flag +0x490 → 0). Carthage's 90-ship fleet (condition 74) sits adjacent to Ptolemaic's weaker 70-ship one (condition 63), at war.
- **It never hunted** (`staged_hunt.jsonl`):
  - In 3 seeds on v3, Carthage's fleet logged neither a hunt nor a port move.
  - The v4 run shows why: the fleet already had a **stored destination, (96,78), at decision time**, although it was −1 in the save. It sailed there, ending the round at (96,78).
- **What set the destination** `[confirmed: decompile]` per ic2-conquest; see the review note, since the tracked excerpt ends before the write: only two places in the code write a fleet's +4 destination, and both are in the army movers.
  - `FUN_0044d9a8`, called from 0x44db8b: an army whose target lies in another region box takes the nearest own launched, empty fleet with moves. If the fleet is adjacent, the army embarks; otherwise the fleet's destination is set to come to the army.
  - 0x44dbc9: an army already aboard steers its fleet.
- **The link here** `[derived]`: Carthage's army 3 stood 3 tiles from (96,78) before the turn, so it most likely called the fleet. The army phase runs before the fleet phase, so **a fleet called as a ferry skips the hunt and the port choice that turn.**

## Evidence

- **Data:** `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt/` (its `README.md` lists every file):
  - hook logs `hook_s{12345,2,10,14}.jsonl`, controls `plain_s{12345,2}.jsonl`, `staged_hunt.jsonl`;
  - checks `analysis_hook_s*.json`, `hunt_bounds_hook_s*.json`, `summary.json`;
  - disassembly excerpts;
  - `EXES-sha256.txt`, `SAVES.sha256`, `MANIFEST-saves.txt`.
- **Code:** `patches/ai_hook.py`, `tests/test_ai_hook.py`.
- **Release** [`run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-ai-intercept-hunt): every autosave of the runs (for example `hook_s2_AUTO0751.SAV`, the 174-tile hunt; `hook_s14_AUTO0758.SAV`, the same-turn war), `staged_hunt_start_carthage_ai.SAV`, and `staged_hunt_s1_AUTO0724.SAV`.
- **Start saves:** `saves/run0-start-AUTO0720-seed12345.SAV`, `saves/fleets-adjacent-at-sea-0723.SAV`.

## Not established

- **The threat-aboard branch** of the intercept (sent to the capital): not seen.
- **The region box** (`FUN_0044eb18`): not modelled. The threat list was not rebuilt independently; the radius and war tests were checked on the chosen threat only.
- **The port choice** (`FUN_0044e9a8`'s candidates and scores): only its branch was checked, not which port won.
- **Hunts by other nations:** only Numidia, Ptolemaic and Carthage hunted. The one seed-14 hunt was logged by v2, which has no fleet ships or condition, so its score was not recomputed.
- **The staged ferry link:** derived; the army's call itself was not hooked.
- **The desktop original:** Wine only.
