# AI-mover contact resolution: the mover onto an occupied tile (in-play corroboration)

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `experiment/ai-mover-contact`,
commits `3d9490c`+`6a535d8`+`2d2251d`; the third is an independent intake of the
first two's work. Independent intake's report kept beside the draft in
`runs/experiments/data/run-exp-ai-contact/`. The natural-play data sits on
[`run-exp-ai-contact`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-ai-contact)
(batches b1, b3; b2 is in the release too).

**Closes** the open-list item of
[`2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md`](2026-10-07-strategic-ai-turn.md) §"What this does
not establish" ("Whether `FUN_0044d734`'s contact resolution differs when the mover is
AI") and the design goal stated in the pending request: that the clone's faithful-AI
path can share one contact resolver with the human twin.

**Tags.** `[derived]` = the decompile's reading (research repo, the strategic-AI-turn
report, plus the bot's own re-reads of the whole-application dump). `[confirmed]` =
this run's saves (bare filenames; SHA-256 in the ic2-conquest repo's
`runs/experiments/data/run-exp-ai-contact/SAVES.sha256`; binaries in release
`run-exp-ai-contact`). `[staged]` = the human-mover control plays, where only the
`moves` word is edited (positions and map natural, labelled `staged_*`).

**Wine-only throughout.** A native Windows run should repeat one both-computer contact
and the two refusal behaviours before the clone treats the outcomes as
platform-independent.

## Answer

- **The AI mover and the human mover share one contact resolver, `FUN_0044d734`** `[derived]`.
  `TUnitMap_MoveHumanArmy` and the AI's destination call `FUN_0044dba8` both call
  `FUN_0044d734`, whose end-of-walk dispatch on the destination cell is owner-agnostic.
  What differs is only who resolves the fight when the tile holds an enemy army: a
  both-computer contact resolves instantly (`FUN_0044aee4`), a contact involving the
  human opens the tactical screen.
- **An AI mover onto an enemy army tile (both seats computer) resolves instantly, with
  no battle screen, and the walk continues past the contact tile** `[confirmed]`. Three
  natural observations in the control run (nothing staged):
  - *Carthage destroys army of Celtiberia* (week 3, `AUTO0720.SAV`→`AUTO0721.SAV`):
    Carthage army 2 (42,63)→(39,64) with the contact at Celtiberia 10's (38,64);
    33,900→22,806 troops; supplies 339→228 = 22,806/100 (the `troops div 100` cap);
    money 597→697 = +100, the loser's purse, exact. News: "Carthage destroys army of
    Celtiberia."
  - *Seleucid destroys army of Bithynia* (week 5, `AUTO0721.SAV`→`AUTO0722.SAV`):
    Seleucid army 5 (179,44)→(185,44), the battle at Bithynia 11's (182,41) **mid-walk**
    (the mover passes through and keeps going); 37,300→23,386 troops; supplies
    299→233 = 23,386/100; money 600→738 (+138; Bithynia's purse was 100 at the turn's
    save, its own economy phase runs first — the +38 gap is the purse's within-turn
    growth, not a payment). News: "Seleucid destroys army of Bithynia." plus the
    Bithynian reparations.
  - *Seleucid destroys army of Ptolemaic* (week 1, in `AUTO0720.SAV`'s news) — same news
    form; the pair's records are masked by id churn and are not itemised here.
  In every case the loser's army record is gone, the news line is the destruction
  notice, and no `BATTLE` window ever appears (the control run's `turn_texts` hold the
  only battle line of the twelve turns: the Gaul-v-Rome one).
- **An AI mover onto a human army tile opens the tactical battle at the human's
  defence** `[confirmed]`. `AUTO0721.SAV`→`AUTO0722.SAV`: Gaul army 9 (74,330 troops,
  money 96, at (100,35)) reaches Rome army 0's neighbourhood; the window
  `Gaul  v  Rome — Rome to place units.` opens (the pump plays it with Computer
  general); Rome 0 ends 23,700→6,596 troops, **money 100→196 (+96, the loser's purse
  absorbed by the defender; the loser is Gaul whose purse was 96)**, supplies 123→65 =
  6,596/100 (the same cap on the battle's supply absorption), **moves 9→9 untouched
  — the defender is not the mover**; Gaul's army record is gone; news: "Rome destroys
  army of Gaul."
- **An AI mover onto a city tile at war is the siege path, instant, no screen**
  `[confirmed]`. Four natural captures in the control run — Dimale (Illyria→Macedonia,
  `AUTO0725.SAV`→`AUTO0726.SAV`), Castulo, Iliturgi, Orangis (Celtiberia→Carthage,
  0727→0728, 0728→0729, 0729→0730) — each moving owner/allegiance, loyalty to the 40
  floor, fort −5…−11, pop −5, with the recurring *fails to capture* rows showing the
  retries (`natural_evidence.txt` tabulates every field).
- **An AI mover onto an army tile not at war does nothing at all** `[derived]`
  (the dispatch skips the attack unless relation is 3 and the mover has moves; no
  natural observation — the run had no such pair).
- **The army-record id churn at Media's capital (307,58) is the merge sub-phase, not
  contact** `[confirmed]`: identical-stat Media armies vanish in successive turns with
  no news line and no foreign army involved — `FUN_004509f0`'s army merge (one record
  removed per turn), which otherwise looks exactly like a destruction in an id-based
  diff.
- **A human mover cannot reach the contact branch with a long walk** `[confirmed,
  staged]`. Two staged plays (only the `moves` word edited via the battles `stage.py`
  — positions and map natural, labelled `staged_through0731.SAV`, `staged_onto0732.SAV`):
  - *Through-click*: from (100,33) with 196 moves, clicking the empty tile (55,33)
    whose straight path crosses Gaul's army at (68,33) — the walker **deviates off the
    row and stops** at (91,32) with 186 moves left, no box, no battle
    (`throughmove_log.v4.json`).
  - *Onto-click*: from (91,32) with 200 moves, clicking Gaul's own tile (68,33) — a
    **silent no-op**: position, moves, treasury, everything unchanged
    (`ontotile_log.json`), the same refusal class as the out-of-reach hire.
  The human's only reachable path onto an enemy army tile is the **adjacent attack
  click**, which opens the tactical battle (the gallic-army experiment) — so "human
  mover contact, defender resolves, no battle" is not reachable through the UI as
  hypothesised; the shared resolver's army-tile branch is, in practice, an AI-mover
  branch (or an adjacent attack).
- **The adjacent through-click (path crossing the enemy tile within ~3 steps) was not
  delivered** `[not established]`. The chase that was to set it up followed a **ghost**:
  the game's memory retains stale records of destroyed armies (the dead 40,500-strong
  start army read live at its last position), so the driver's memory scan marched Rome
  to an empty tile while the real Gaul army besieged Locri and Rhegium
  (`b3a_AUTO0733.SAV`–`b3a_AUTO0738.SAV`; the run stopped on the owner's wind-down
  before the closing armies met). Driver caveat recorded: memory army scans must filter
  liveness (a save's dead slots read owner −1; memory's do not). Byproduct: a further
  natural AI-AI destruction in `b3a_AUTO0738.SAV`'s news (*Illyria destroys army of
  Greece*).

## Method

- **Environment.** A dedicated Wine prefix (`ic2-work-contact`), Xvfb `:601` and a
  copy of the game folder, so other sessions' games cannot interfere; the driver
  patch in this branch selects the game pid by its working directory (the first pgrep
  match could be another session's game).
- **The decompile read.** `FUN_0044d734` walks the mover to its destination and
  dispatches on the destination cell: an army band (200–247) calls `FUN_0044aee4`
  **only** when the nations are at war and the mover has moves left — otherwise nothing
  happens at all; a city (20–99) at war calls the siege `FUN_0044b27c`, not at war the
  resupply `FUN_0044f6d8`. The human twin `TUnitMap_MoveHumanArmy` calls the same
  `FUN_0044d734`. `FUN_0044aee4` is the instant resolution: it requires **both**
  nations' computer-seat flags, plays `MakeSound(9)` (case 9: army battle between two
  non-local seats), zeroes the mover's moves, calls `FUN_0044ae20` for losses, and
  transfers the loser's `+0x7c1f8` (army money) **to the winner** at `+0x7c1f6`. The
  human-involved branch is a `BATTLE` window, and `FUN_0044ae20` is also called from
  there to apply losses before the tactical screen closes.
- **Batches.**
  - `b1` (control): fresh `new_game` seed 424242, Rome idle, one save per turn
    0720–0732; reproduces the ai-turn run's snapshots turn for turn
    (`control_vs_ai_turn.txt`). It re-collects the natural evidence: the AI-mover-vs-
    human-army contact of 0721→0722 and the Celtiberian sieges (`natural_evidence.txt`).
  - `b2`: extension of the same game past 0732, watching for a both-computer army
    contact (the instant `FUN_0044aee4` branch). Observed within the same window.
  - `b3` (human-mover control): the run-0 start (`BASE.SAV`), the proven join-and-march
    sequence to Gaul's army, then a MOVE (not the attack click) whose destination is
    the enemy army's tile; `humanmover_log.json` records position, popups, battle
    window and the army record around the contact.

## Observations

- The control run's twelve turns contain exactly **one** battle window (`Gaul  v  Rome —
  Rome to place units.`); every other armed contact — two army destructions between
  computer seats, four city captures, several failed sieges — resolves with **no window
  and no screen**, only news lines and record diffs (`natural_evidence.txt`).
- The destruction news form is always "*<winner> destroys army of <loser>.*", distinct
  from the capture form "*<city> (<nation>) falls to <nation>.*" and the defection
  form.
- The winner of an instant army contact holds **supplies = troops div 100** afterwards
  in both observed pairs (228 = 22,806/100; 233 = 23,386/100) — the same cap every
  other supply writer applies — and its money rises by the loser's purse (Carthage
  +100 exact; Seleucid +138 with the loser's save-time purse at 100 and its own
  economy phase in between).
- The defending human's army keeps its `moves` through the battle (Rome 0: 9→9);
  every AI army shows moves 0 in these saves regardless, so the mover's moves-zeroing
  (`FUN_0044aee4` writes 0 before resolving) is not separately measurable here.
- A click on a *distant* enemy-army tile (Chebyshev 3) issues a plain walk, not an
  attack: no box, no battle window on that turn (`humanmover_log.json` turn 0).
- A click on a *path* crossing an enemy tile deviates off the row and stops short;
  a click on the enemy tile itself is a silent no-op. Both are observed in the
  staged human-mover control.

## Inferences

- **The clone's faithful-AI path can share one contact resolver with the human twin**
  (the pending request's design goal): the decompile routes both through
  `FUN_0044d734`, and the plays show the observable outcomes match the dispatch table
  — at-war army tile ⇒ fight (instant between computers, screen when a human
  defends), at-war city tile ⇒ siege, other city ⇒ resupply, not-at-war army tile ⇒
  nothing.
- The **mid-walk contact** (Seleucid passing through (182,41) and finishing at
  (185,44)) says the contact check runs **per step of the walk**, not only at the
  destination — matching `FUN_0044d734`'s per-step structure, and meaning a blocked
  destination is not required to provoke a contact.
- The instant path's **loss arithmetic** (`FUN_0044ae20` with the type matrix) is
  not re-derived here; the two observed losses (11,094 of 33,900 and 13,914 of 37,300)
  are cited as bounds for whoever does.
- The **long-walk deviation-and-stop** is real but unexplained; a clone reproducing
  "refuse/stopper" behaviour needs its own dig. The pattern (path-target off the
  Manhattan row, exact moves-left after) is consistent with a per-order step cap that
  does not match the per-tile cost table, and with no documented "stuck" form in
  the refusal-text corpus — the closest cited pattern is the out-of-reach hire
  silent no-op.

## What this does not establish

- **Wine-only** throughout; the desktop original should repeat one both-computer
  contact and the refusal behaviours before the clone treats the outcomes as
  platform-independent.
- The **not-at-war army-tile contact** (dispatch: nothing at all) has no natural
  observation in this run — `[derived]` only.
- The **adjacent through-click** (a short human walk whose path crosses the enemy
  tile) — the chase set up for it followed a stale memory slot and the run stopped
  before a second attempt; not tested.
- The instant path's **exact loss formula** (values, matrix, rounding) — decompile-only
  here.
- The AI mover's **moves-zeroing** is not separately observable (all AI armies read
  moves 0 at save time).
- Whether a human MOVE onto an **occupied city tile at war** opens the siege dialog
  or resolves silently — not played in this run.
- Why the long walk **deviates and stops** (pathing rule, per-order step cap) —
  observed, not explained; a clone reproducing "refuse/stopper" behaviour needs its
  own dig.
