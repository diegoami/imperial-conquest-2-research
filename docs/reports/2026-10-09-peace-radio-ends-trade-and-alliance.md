# The original's Peace radio ends a trade (−8) or an alliance (−24) on both sides at OK, with no box and no news; Cancel discards. The remake's engine does the same for a trade, but its app offers Make Peace only at war

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit `e091835`. Release
[`run-exp-peace-radio`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-peace-radio) holds
the 8 saves and 2 screenshots, and their SHA-256s are committed at
`runs/experiments/data/run-exp-peace-radio/SAVES.sha256`. Wine-only. The remake transcript and saves are
in `run-exp-gap-v050`. This is original-side check 1 of
[`2026-10-09-remake-v050-gap-analysis.md`](2026-10-09-remake-v050-gap-analysis.md), and it settles the
condition on NEW-g1-2.

**Review note:**
- All 8 saves hash OK.
- **The relations, read with my own script** (nation table found by Rome's colour dwords, relation at
  `+0x26 + other × 2`), as Rome→Illyria / Illyria→Rome:
  - A, trade: `A_before` 1 / 1, `A_after` −8 / −8, `A_…AUTO0721` −8 / −8.
  - B, Cancel: both `B_after_cancel` saves 1 / 1.
  - D, staged alliance: `D_start…allied` 2 / 2, `D_after` −24 / −24, `D_…AUTO0721` −24 / −24.
- **This is the first in-play confirmation of the setter table** in
  [`decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md`](decompiled-diplomacy-peace-terms-and-instant-battles.md).
  `FUN_00449B40(a, b, 0)` writes both `[a][b]` and `[b][a]`, and turns "peace" into a cooldown by the
  previous state: trade → −8, alliance → −24. Both values and the symmetry are what the saves show.
- **The remake side** (`check1_*` saves, the CLI transcript) was not re-read here.

**Tag:** `[confirmed]` (Wine) for the trade case and Cancel; L1 (staged) for the alliance case; the
remake's app gating is a code reading (checked at `37f3062` in the gap analysis's review).

## Answer

- **Peace on a trade partner** `[confirmed]`: at the start `run0-start-AUTO0720-seed12345.SAV`, Rome trades with Illyria (relation 1 both ways). Peace radio on Illyria, OK:
  - the relation becomes **−8 on both sides at once**;
  - no box opens, and no news line follows (`A_20261009-175015_AUTO0721.SAV`);
  - the −8 is still there after the End turn.
  - Saves: `A_20261009-175015_A_before.SAV` → `A_20261009-175015_A_after.SAV`.
- **Peace on an ally** `[confirmed]`, L1: with Rome–Illyria set to 2 (allied) both ways in the start save (`D_20261009-175644_start_rome_illyria_allied.SAV`), Peace radio on Illyria, OK:
  - the relation becomes **−24 on both sides**;
  - no box, no news line (`D_20261009-175644_AUTO0721.SAV`), and the −24 holds after End turn.
  - Save after: `D_20261009-175644_D_after.SAV`.
- **No natural alliance at this start:** Alliance proposed to each of the 15 nations was refused every time: "X does not want to ally with your nation." (`peace_radio-C-*.jsonl`).
- **Cancel discards** `[confirmed]`: clicking the Peace radio on Illyria and then Cancel leaves the relation at 1 (`B_20261009-175604_B_after_cancel.SAV`; screenshot `B_20261009-175604_peace_clicked.png`).
  - A radio click alone commits nothing: the dialog commits at OK.
  - In the first run the Cancel click only activated the window (a known driver pitfall); the second run's third click closed the dialog.
- **The remake** (v0.5.0, CLI): `make-peace macedonia` on a trade partner also gives **−8 both ways**, kept after `end` (`cli/check1_peace_on_trade.txt`, `check1_before.sav` → `check1_after_trade_peace.sav` → `check1_after_end.sav`). The engine matches.
  - **But the app enables Make Peace only at war** (`godot/Screens/DiplomacyGridViewModel.cs:69`, `CanMakePeace: isWar`, code reading).
  - So **in the Godot app a player cannot end a trade or an alliance**, which the original allows. With 3 trade partners, no new trade can be made. The ally case was not run on the remake.
- **For the gap analysis:**
  - NEW-g1-2's condition holds: `differs`, `blocks a normal game`, no longer conditional.
  - S02's "OK commits, Cancel discards" is confirmed on the original side. The remake's screen commits each click at once (rows_g1 S02).

## Evidence

- **Data:** `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-peace-radio/` (`peace_radio.py`, `peace_radio-{A,B,C,D}-*.jsonl`, `SAVES.sha256`, `README.md`).
- **Release:** [`run-exp-peace-radio`](https://github.com/diegoami/ic2-conquest/releases/tag/run-exp-peace-radio).
- **The remake's side:** `runs/experiments/data/run-exp-gap-v050/cli/check1_peace_on_trade.txt`; the `check1_*.sav` saves are added to release `run-exp-gap-v050`.

## Not established

- **A natural alliance** (none formed at this start); the ally case is staged.
- **The remake's value after ending an alliance**, not run. The −24 is the original's.
- **The Godot screen itself:** its Make Peace gating is code reading.
- **The desktop original:** Wine only.
