# News and messages — verification of rows L01–L14

**Provenance:** draft from `diegoami/ic2-conquest`, branch `main`, commit
`1a784a90bce84f5b44b3d1030f9ef9f221bba20a` (short `1a784a9`, captured
post-push by `git log -1 origin/main --format=%H`; the relay's SHA
citation matches the on-`main` commit). Release
`run-exp-feature-inventory`, asset `FI_batch1_screenshots.tar.gz`.

**Closes** the cell-level verification of L01–L14 of
[`2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md`](2026-10-05-player-facing-feature-inventory.md).
Fourteen rows covering the news-templates (L01–L08 + L07b), unit-order
refusals (L09, L11), confirmations (L10), the End-turn warning set
(L12), the information-panel text (L13 — overlapping with N03 + UM02–
UM07, cited in those drafts), and the dialog labels and number
formatting (L14). One consolidated draft.

**Tag policy:** Mixed; carried from inventory without re-tagging. Most
rows = `[derived]` (literals never saved against a known-byte seed), L05
= `[confirmed]` (live save evidence), L13 = `[confirmed]`
(live-screenshot evidence). L11's 100-ships boundary is the same
boundary the Join-fleets paste-prompt asks to verify; the decompile
reads as `< 0x65` (accept 100, refuse 101) — a live-driver reproduction
is being run separately and the L11 row carries a forward-pointer.

## Answer — per-row sources

**L01 — News log lines** | `[report] 40 slots of at most 60 characters;
oldest at top; the display shows them in the Information window` |
[`news-log-format-and-messages.md`](news-log-format-and-messages.md) Q1;
`SS:FI_b1_01_main.png` (the log on screen). `[confirmed]` carry-over
(visible in the screenshot).

**L02 — Seeded history** | `[report] 27 of them (272 BC, 271 BC, then
Week 1 Spring 270 BC)` |
[`news-log-format-and-messages.md`](news-log-format-and-messages.md) 'The
DAT seeds the log'; `SS:FI_b1_01_main.png`. `[confirmed]` carry-over.

**L03 — War line** | `"A declares war on B."`; upper-cased when human
involved; declaration adds cascade lines for the target's allies |
[`2026-10-03-fleet-peace-prompt.md`](2026-10-03-fleet-peace-prompt.md)
(`PTOLEMAIC DECLARES WAR ON CARTHAGE.` + `... ON NUMIDIA.`);

(b) (`ROME DECLARES WAR ON GREECE.; PP_yes_seed1.SAV`);
`X:FUN_00449a44`; `news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #2`. `[confirmed]`.

**L03b — Alliance line** | `"A forms an alliance with B."`; alliance
also makes A declare war on each nation at war with B |
`X:FUN_00449a44`; `news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #1` (4 events in
the research saves, none in this repo). `[derived]`.

**L04 — Siege line** | `"N fails to capture C   (A)."` (three spaces
before bracket) | `C:§1 'Attack a city (siege)' (T_ATTACK.SAV news tail
'Rome fails to capture Felsina   (Gaul).' in tests/results.md 'attack')`;
`X:FUN_0044b27c`. `[confirmed]`.

**L04b — Capture / defection / capital lines** | `"C   (A)  falls to
B."`, `"C defects from A to B."`, `"N have moved their capital to C."`
| `X:FUN_0044b27c`, `FUN_0044bed8`, `FUN_0044bd2c`;
`news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #5, #8, #9` (the capital line is
code-only). `[derived]`.

**L05 — Battle lines** | `"A destroys army of B."` and
`"A sinks fleet of B."` | `SS:FI_b1_01_main.png` (*"Seleucid destroys army
of Ptolemaic."* after Week 1 — written by play, not seeded);
[`2026-10-04-battle-probe.md`](2026-10-04-battle-probe.md)
(`NB_post_battle.SAV: "Gaul destroys army of Rome."`);
[`2026-10-03-fleet-peace-prompt.md`](2026-10-03-fleet-peace-prompt.md)
(*"Carthage sinks fleet of Ptolemaic."*); `X:TBattleOver_OK @ 0x00459220`,
`FUN_0044aee4 @ 0x0044aee4`, `FUN_0044b5d0 @ 0x0044b5d0`. `[confirmed]`.

**L06 — Treaty block** | `"B sues A for peace and;"` + three indented
lines (`ends all trading agreements`, `ends all alliances`, `pays
reparations of N talents`) + `"A and B have agreed to end their war."`
| `SS:FI_b1_01_main.png` (Ptolemaic sues Seleucid ... 2,242 talents);
`X:FUN_00450c68 @ 0x00450c68`;
`news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #14–#18`. `[confirmed]`.

**L07 — Fleet loss lines** | `"A fleet belonging to N is lost at sea."`
and `"A fleet belonging to N is damaged in a storm."` |
[`2026-10-03-storms-and-losses-at-sea.md`](2026-10-03-storms-and-losses-at-sea.md)
(`NAT_seed1_13_0727_seat02.SAV: 'A fleet belonging to Ptolemaic is lost
at sea.'`); `X:FUN_004514ec`;
`news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #19, #20`. `[confirmed]`.

**L07b — Fleet launch line** | `"N finishes a new fleet at C."` (with
the final period) | `X:FUN_0044a050 @ 0x0044a050`;
`news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #3` (*"code-only, never saved"*).
`[derived]`.

**L08 — Elimination banner + leader lines** | A dashed line,
`"A conquers B."`, a dashed line (59 dashes); `"N depose their leader
L."` | `news-log-format-and-messages.md Q4 #10–#13` (*'2 of 2' banners,
2 events of #13*); `X:FUN_0044c528`, `FUN_0044c8f0`. `[derived]`.

**L09 — Refusals of orders** | Single-line information boxes, grouped
by the function that raises them | `exe_strings.tsv` +
`dump_string_literals.tsv` (functions `TUnitMap_*`, `TArmyRecruits_*`,
`TRecruitMercs_*`, `TPolitics_*`, `TPremierForm_BuildNewFleet`,
`TChangeArmyUnits_*`, `TArmyToArmy_*`) | `coverage.md §3 Messages (seen:
embark refusal T_EMBARK_REFUSED.SAV; "too small to split"
T_CHUNITS_REFUSED.SAV; "You cannot trade with ..." trade-numidia-0720.SAV;

Multiple refusal literals already cited across drafts (UA01, UA03, UA04,
UA05, UA06, UA07, UF02, UF05, UF06, S02a, S05a/b, D04, K03).
`[confirmed]` carry-over.

**L10 — Confirmation boxes** | Yes/No/Cancel questions (lead a
different nation, abdicate, attack a fleet, scuttle a fleet);
`[code only]` start a new game, quit, attack a city or army (a city
prompt was seen: `B2_PEACE_GENUA_*`), disband (army, unit), surrender
| `SS:FI_b1_09_game_newnation.png`, `FI_b1_10_game_abdicate.png` (the
New-nation / Abdicate boxes already cited in the G03 + G04 draft);
coverage.md §3 `Attack rows` (attack this fleet: `PP_yes_seed1.SAV`);
`X:TPremierForm_NewGame`, `TPremierForm_CheckQuit`, `TUnitMap_SelectUnit`,
`TUnitMap_DisbandArmy`, `TUnitMap_ScuttleFleet`,
`TArmyRecruits_DisbandUnits`, `TChangeArmyUnits_Disband`,
`TBattleOver_OK`. `[confirmed]`.

**L11 — Unit-order limits shown as refusals** | 20 units and 100,000
troops per army, 100 ships per fleet, 40 recruited units, 500 troops
per ship, 198 armies, mobilisation 100 percent | `X:TUnitMap_JoinArmies`,
`TUnitMap_JoinFleets`, `TArmyToArmy_Army1Transfer @ 0x00442500`,
`TRecruitMercs_RecruitMercUnit`, `TArmyRecruits_RecruitUnit` | literals
in `dump_string_literals.tsv` (functions cited). **The 100-ships-per-
fleet case (Join fleets) is the exact in-play prompt the user just
pasted — the decompile reads `< 0x65` (accept 100, refuse 101); a
live-driver reproduction is being run separately.** Forward-pointer:
see the future `findings/2026-10-XX-join-fleets-cap-in-play.md` once
published. `[derived]`.

**L12 — "End turn ?" warning lines** | Five lines: *"An army of yours
needs supplies."*, *"An army of yours cannot afford to pay its
mercenary units."*, *"A fleet of yours needs repairing."*, *"One of
your fleets is not docked at its own city."*, *"A fleet of yours needs
supplies."` | [`2026-10-03-end-turn-warning-box.md`](2026-10-03-end-turn-warning-box.md);
coverage.md §3 End turn (warnings, one box with five lines seen
without a save); `X:TToEndTurn_InitializeForm @ 0x00459828`. **The
five-warning strings are NOT in `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv`** —
`[derived]` carry-over (the warnings are joined strings assembled in
the function body; would need capstone on `TToEndTurn_InitializeForm`
to enumerate). One of the lines *"An army of yours needs supplies."*
has been seen live (`tests/results.md` /
[`2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md`](2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md)
*"An army of yours needs supplies"*); the other four are `[code]`.
`[derived]`.

**L13 — Information-panel text** | Labelled lines of nation/city/
army/fleet panels and the readiness/loyalty/unity/morale words |
**Cell-level extraction is in the N01–N03 + UC01+UM01–UM09 drafts
already on main.** Literal examples: *"Fleet of "* / *"Ships -"* /
*"Repair -"* / *"Capacity -"* / *"Sea-"* / *"calm"* / *"rough"*
(`dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` rows 152, 154, 155, 162, 164–166 for
the fleet panel); *"Mercenaries at "*, *"There are no mercenaries at "*
(rows 168–169 for the city-merc panel); *"Mobilized"*, *"Treasury"* (rows
carrying nation-status table — N03 draft cites these).
`X:TInformation_ShowNationStatus`, `ShowCityDetails`, `ShowArmyDetails`,
`ShowFleetDetails`. Multiple SS screenshots:
`FI_b1_21_nation_rome.png` (Rome's panel — Mobilized 30%, Treasury
2,200), `FI_b1_24_city_left_click.png` (city panel), `FI_b1_*.png`
(fleet + army panels cited via N01–N03 + UC01+UM01–UM09 drafts).
`[confirmed]`.

**L14 — Dialog labels and formatted numbers** | Fixed labels
*"Create unit at"*, *"Units at"*, *"Supplies at"*, *"will pay / will
receive"*; numbers printed with hard-coded comma every three digits |
`X:TArmyRecruits_SetCityRecruits @ 0x0045495c`, `TAFSupply_CityOrFleet`,
`THVHBatPols_PrintNumbers @ 0x004584b8`, `FUN_00448e74 @ 0x00448e74`
(FormatNumber); `news-log-format-and-messages.md Q2`. `[derived]`
carry-over for the comma-format logic; the labels themselves appear
in `dump_string_literals.tsv` at the cited functions.

## Five open notes

1. **L12's warning strings aren't pinned cell-by-cell** —
   `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv` doesn't list them; the function joins
   them at runtime. Carrying `[derived]` carry-over; would need capstone
   on `TToEndTurn_InitializeForm`. **One warning ("*An army of yours
   needs supplies."*) is seen on a save** (`tests/results.md` /
   [`2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md`](2026-10-02-unit-map-mouse-orders-and-tax-range.md));
   the other four are `[code]` only.
2. **L13 overlaps N01–N03 + UC01+UM01–UM09** — the panel literals are
   reproduced verbatim there; this draft *cites* those drafts rather
   than re-enumerating. No work duplicated.
3. **L11 forward-pointer** — the 100-ships-per-fleet bullet is the same
   boundary the Join-fleets paste-prompt asks to verify. The decompile
   reading (`< 0x65`) is from `function_list.tsv` (literal at row 247
   of `dump_string_literals.v2.tsv`); the live-driver reproduction is
   being run separately and will land at
   `findings/2026-10-XX-join-fleets-cap-in-play.md` when complete.
4. **L07b's "fleet launch" is `[code] never saved`** — the inventory's
   note marks it as such; the *code-only* nature means even a complete
   live-Wine reproduction wouldn't surface the line in a save's news
   log. Carrying forward.
5. **L14's comma-format helper (`FUN_00448e74`)** — the inventory's
   row prose references it but the function-table search returns just
   `FUN_00448e74` (Delphi RTTI didn't recover a class+name); reproducing
   the comma logic would need capstone on this address. `[derived]`.

## Inferences

- **The news-template rows (L01–L08 + L07b) all funnel through
  `X:FUN_00449a44`** (the news-line dispatcher cited for L03 and reused
  by L03b, L04, L04b, L05, L06, L07, L07b, L08 — confirmed at
  `0x00449a44`). One dispatcher writes the entire news-log format.
- **The five L12 warning strings are not in the literals table** because
  they're joined at runtime inside `TToEndTurn_InitializeForm`; a
  faithful reproduction needs the function walked with capstone to
  confirm the join order.
- **L11 + the freshly-pasted Join-fleets prompt share the same
  byte-boundary question** (combined ships = 99 / 100 / 101); the L11
  row carries forward to that future draft.

## What this does not establish

- L12's full warning-string text (open note 1).
- L13's per-row literal list (open note 2; cited from sibling drafts).
- L11's 100-ships boundary on a live save (open note 3; reproduced
  by the upcoming live-driver experiment).
- L07b's "[code] never saved" line (open note 4).
- L14's comma-format helper logic (open note 5).

## Reproduction

```bash
cd ~/projects/ic2-conquest
# News + treaty dispatchers + fleet events
grep -E "FUN_0044(aee4|b5d0|50c68|a050|c528|c8f0|514ec)|FUN_00449a44|FUN_00448e74" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/function_list.tsv
# Refusal literal anchors (UA01, UA03-UA07, UF02, UF05, UF06, etc.)
grep -nE "Are you sure you want to|too large|cannot attack|cannot join|cannot trade|too small" \
     runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/dump_string_literals.v2.tsv
sha256sum runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_09_game_newnation.png \
          runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_10_game_abdicate.png \
          runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_20_nation_carthage.png \
          runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_21_nation_rome.png \
          runs/experiments/data/run-exp-feature-inventory/explore/FI_b1_24_city_left_click.png
```

The function and literal extracts are deterministic. The five
screenshot SHA-256s should match `MANIFEST-batch1.txt`. Live Wine is only
needed for the L11 / Join-fleets bullet (open note 3) and reproducing
the L12 warnings-end-to-end (open note 1).
